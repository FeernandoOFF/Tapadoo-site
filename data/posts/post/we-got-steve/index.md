A few weeks back, as the work continued to mount, we realised it was time to expand again. We put out a tweet looking for an intern, and were delighted that Steven Troughton-Smith expressed an interest.

For those of you who within the iPhone development community, Steven needs no introduction. For the rest of you, let me explain.

![Steven Troughton-Smith](images/sts-300x274.png "Steven Troughton-Smith") Steven has garnered plenty of attention for his accomplishments as an iPhone developer. He's been featured on [RTE News](http://vimeo.com/3289258) during the iPhone Gold Rush of '08, and [more recently for his app "Grace"](http://vimeo.com/8124035), an iPhone app which helps Autistic children communicate.

Engadget have also been [interested in his work on jailbroken devices](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/15/jailbroken-iphone-gets-expose-like-view-you-retail-users-just-k/), while Gizmodo also broke the story of [how Steve hacked the palm pre](http://gizmodo.com/5288989/running-custom-firmware-on-the-palm-pre-is-rather-easy).

Phew! Hopefully, we'll be able to channel all this enthusiasm!

I'm sure you'll join me in welcoming Steven to the team at Tapadoo
