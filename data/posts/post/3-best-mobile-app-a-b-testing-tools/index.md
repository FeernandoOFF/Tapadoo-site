#### Optimizely Reviews

Optimizely is the go-to platform for A/B testing for enterprise clients. Many reviewers across a number of reviewing platforms have noted that it is easy to use and understand. Optimizely analyses the data for you, so it's simply a matter of observing the data. Other users have noted its ability to segment users based on attributes such as age, location, and platform, and evaluate interface concepts, data and headline changes, as well as the phased deployment of completed features. Also, the rich dashboard to monitor experiments and provide data snapshots during a campaign.

On the negative side, it has been noted that app integration is more challenging than the script used for the web, although there are client libraries in Swift, Java and other languages to make it easier.

#### Optimizely Pricing
