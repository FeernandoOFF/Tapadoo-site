[App Annie](https://www.appannie.com/en/) released their [State of Mobile 2020](https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2020/) report earlier this year. We’ve selected some top-line information on the effects of mobile on the finance industry. 

There’s a trend globally for consumers to migrate more of their financial activities to mobile. Both Google and Apple are taking advantage of this trend with Google offering checking accounts and Apple offering a credit card.

In 2019 consumers accessed finance apps over 1 trillion times. This is up 100% from 2017. Consumers are using their mobiles for payment apps, mobile banking apps and stock management apps. 

One way for finance apps to engage users is by offering loyalty and referral programs, with Citi reporting that [83% of consumers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/05/02/when-it-comes-to-customer-engagement-loyalty-matters-at-citi/%236ca973fe7fb6/) and [94% of millennials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/05/02/when-it-comes-to-customer-engagement-loyalty-matters-at-citi/%236ca973fe7fb6/) more likely to participate in a loyalty program if it’s on mobile. 

The chart below is the total sessions in finance apps in select markets on Android phones. The growth rate for China is year over year.

### **Banking and Fintech Wallet Apps**

Fintech wallet apps globally engaged users one more time per user each week than traditional banking wallet apps. The extra 52 sessions per year for each user represents a large volume of transactions for Fintech wallet apps. However, banking wallet apps saw far greater engagement per user in countries such as Indonesia, Brazil, France, Germany, Canada, Russia and the UK.

You can see that Fintech wallet apps in both China and South Korea have had large growth.
