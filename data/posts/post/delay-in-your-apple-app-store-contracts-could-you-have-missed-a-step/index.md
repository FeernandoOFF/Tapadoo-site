I've been getting antsy about the length of time it was taking to get my app store contracts in place (over 4 weeks now).

I was talking to someone this morning who had his sailed through, so I asked him about the length of time it took. He mentioned that it was only a week since he had sent his contract to Texas.

Hold on. Sent the what to where now? I checked itunesconnect; I downloaded the contracts that were pending. Nowhere did I find anything to suggest I had to send something to Apple. So...I spoke to the guy on Skype (thanks @grib!). After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing he mentioned a mail he had received from Apple.

So I went back over mails I had received. Sure enough, as part of the process they mail you your W-8BEN contract along with the following instructions:

> Please print the attached .pdf and follow the instructions included. If you have any questions regarding the tax form, please see our Frequently Asked Questions on iTunes Connect. If you have further questions, email iTStax@apple.com.

D'Oh!

So...if you've had a delay...perhaps it was because you missed this step?

Having said all of this, there does not appear to be an equivalent step for free apps, and these contracts are still pending for me for over 4 weeks too.

If only someone from Apple would answer a mail. If you've had similar experiences, feel free to comment.
