> **"Well, just because people are vocal about it, doesn't mean everyone hates it, we should probably run a survey and check analytics"**  
>   
> "The findings are in! Loads of people hate it, some like it. If we get rid of it we'll annoy 7.24% of our audience"  
> "The retention team don't like the sound of that figure..."  
> "We better make it configurable on the account so."  
> "On the _account_, or on the _profile_?"  
> "What do you mean?"  
> "What if, Mom likes the auto play feature, but Dad hates it?"  
> "ahhhhh"

> **"Hey everyone, we're going to make the auto play feature configurable!"**  
> "Wait. When you say 'auto play feature' do you mean the feature where you're finished watching an episode and the next one auto plays?"  
> "YES!"  
> "NO!"  
> "Huh?"  
> "Well, I"m talking about the feature where I'm trying to _browse_, and it auto plays trailers"  
> "Well, _I'm_ talking about when the next episode auto plays"  
> "Oh"  

> **"OK, We better make both of them configurable"**  
> "Someone call the UX team, and find out the best way to do it"  
> "And let the database team know we'll need a new flag on the user profile table"

> **"A new flag? What will be put in as default for the hundreds of millions of existing profiles?"**  
> "Let's meet up to discuss this"  

> **"Who's responsible for the API? They're going to need to make a change to carry the new flag"**  
> "you mean flags."  
> "Yes. You're right 'flags'"

> **"The API team have been in touch; they've made the new change to the login profile, they want to know should they change the POST to profile to change the value?"**  
> "What for?"  
> "To _save_ the user's preference"  
> "Oh, yeah. We better get that done too"  

> **"How are the front end team doing on the UI?"**  
> "Awaiting designs"

> **"The UI team are done. The new switch is in the profile screen, it's working great on chrome and safari. Just have a minor fix for Firefox to complete". It'll be in QA by tomorrow.**  
> "Right, how are the Apple TV team doing?"  
> "Oh, they've a scheduled release in 1 month, so this change is on their backlog"  

> **Have the carousel team wrote the code to not auto play?**  
> yep!

> **"What about the LG TV Team?"  
> "What about The Android Team"  
> "The iPad Team?"  
> "The Roku Team?"**
