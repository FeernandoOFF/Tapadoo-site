Technology has revolutionised the retail industry with shopping apps paving the way for retailers to interact with consumers in a more personal and targeted way. Reaching consumers with discounts and special offers is more effective through an app that people have signed up to than printed material or billboards. Through a compelling user experience, users are more inclined to sign up to loyalty programs and be open to receive push notifications.

A survey from [Visual Objects](https://visualobjects.com/app-development/top-mobile-app-development-companies/when-where-people-use-shopping-apps) found the reason for the success of larger-scale shopping apps was a streamlined user experience and brand recognition, inferring that smaller brands could garner similar success through building trust while also delivering an exceptional user experience.

While driving discounts and lower prices is an important marketing strategy for many retailers, it's not the only reason why millennials downloads apps. 54% download retail apps because it is often easier to download and use the app than it is to use the mobile site.
