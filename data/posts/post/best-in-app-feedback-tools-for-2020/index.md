In-app feedback is a great way of capturing users’ paint points within your app, along with their overall thoughts, ideas and specific requests for improvement. In-app feedback tools capture this data in real-time, making it an ideal way to interact with users. These tools give insight into how you can improve the usability of your app. They can also be the start of deep-dive discussions with users to help get a detailed understanding of your app from a users point of view.

Here are some of the top tools for 2020.

[Instabug](https://instabug.com/) is a mobile in-app feedback tool as well as a bug detection tool. You can use this tool if your app is in beta or in production. Instabug makes it easy for users to send feedback right from inside your app, and you’ll receive more and better quality comments.

Its features include screenshot annotations, voice notes, screen recording, user profiles, network logging and third-party integrations.

Instabug is used by the likes of PayPal, BuzzFeed, Asana, Samsung, NextDoor, OnePlue and Sound Cloud. It’s a great tool to allow users and beta testers notify you of bugs in your app.
