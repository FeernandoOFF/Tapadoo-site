Whether you travel by bike, bus, train, Luas or car we’ve compiled all the travel apps you need to help you with your journey.

## **Travel Apps specific to Dublin**

### **Travelling by bike**

Our first category, travelling by bike, only turns up bike apps in Dublin. Sorry rest of Ireland! 

#### **Dublin Bikes App**

Just Eat dublinbikes is a self-service bike rental system open to everyone from 14 years of age. It enables you to travel through the city centre, commute between home and work and get out and about to enjoy Dublin city at your leisure.

They currently have 102 stations for their bikes. See their full list of stations [here](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Stations/View-stations/Just-Eat-dublinbikes-station-list). Note: some of these stations are credit card enabled but not all! It’s more convenient to download the app.

You can enjoy a 3 day pass or an annual subscription of €25 and then there’s a pricing structure to use the app. See their pricing structure [here](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Subscription/Pricing-Structure/Pricing-structure). 

**Download the App**

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcdecaux.dublinbikes&hl=en_IE)

#### **Bleeperbike App**

Beeeperbike is another bike hiring scheme, again operating in Dublin. Although they have a pilot scheme in Sligo. The difference with Bleeperbikes and Dublinbikes is that Bleeperbikes is stationless. Using their clever locking system, Bleeperbikes allows you to park at any recognised public parking stand in Dublin. You can use their app to identify these spaces. You must park the bike within the Green Zone, which you can find on their app. If you park the bike outside the green zone for collection you will incur an additional cost.

#### **Dublin Cycle Planner App**

The [Dublin Cycle Planner](http://www.transportforireland.ie/walking-cycling/about-dublin-cycle-planner/) provides information on the best cycling routes in Dublin based on individual cycling capabilities. If you are new to cycling or getting out on the bike after a long break, the Cycle Planner will find a route that avoids roads with heavy traffic and also avoids difficult turns at busy junctions to help you get comfortable cycling your bike around town.

For the more advanced cyclists the cycle planner will tell you about the most direct route to take whilst still recommending cycle tracks where they exist. The cycle planner covers Dublin city centre and all the larger towns around County Dublin.

### **Travelling by bus**

#### **Dublin Bus App**

The Dublin Bus app provides real-time information. It estimates the time your bus is due at your stop. You can also calculate your fare, get bus timetables and a route planner. There doesn't seem to be an official Dublin Bus Android version of the app but I found an alternative that has received a lot of good reviews. Check it out for yourself on the Google Play store.

### **Travelling by Luas**

#### **Luas App**

Dublin’s tram network has its very own app. It provides real time forecasts of tram arrivals at each stop. The app also allows you to identify your nearest stop and get directions to it, calculate fares between two stops and check operating hours. It also provides live travel updates regarding its service.

You can see up to date information of when your bus/Luas/train will be at a stop or station. You can also view stops and routes on a map and navigate through the map for additional stops and information. The app allows you to set up favourites so that you can quickly access real time information for your regular stop. It creates reminders to notify you when a bus is approaching your stop, or when you are near a certain bus stop. You can set alerts when your bus is 10, 20 or 30 minutes away from a certain bus stop, so you can plan when to leave home or work. It also informs you when you are approaching a particular bus stop (GPS dependent).

#### **Leap Top-App App**

The Leap Card app allows you to pay for public transport in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, Althlone and Wexford. Fares are up to 31% cheaper using a Leap Card. Dublin users also have additional benefits, such as capping and leap 90 discount. If you travel a lot in one day or one week on Dublin Bus, Go-Ahead Ireland, Luas, Dart and Commuter Rail, they’ll automatically cap the price so you don’t spend any more than you need to. Once you’ve reached the cap you travel for free. 

The app is a free app for NFC enabled Android phones. It allows you to instantly top-up your Leap Card, check your balance and collect tickets. Once downloaded, simply hold your Leap Card to the back of your NFC-enabled Android smartphone to instantly check your balance, collect a pre-paid ticket, or top-up your Leap Card – anytime, anywhere.

If driving your own car and it breaks down it’s easier and quicker to report the breakdown through the AA app than giving them a call.

#### **Toyota FaceIt Down App**

The Toyota FaceItDown app uses your phone’s location tracking GPS to track how many kilometres you have driven without picking up your phone, and tracks that your phone is kept in a screen down position whilst tracking is active – hence ‘FaceitDown’! When you are finished your journey, each kilometre you’ve travelled without picking up your phone will result in a point, and when you have accumulated enough points, you will be given rewards!

When you have built up enough points, the reward will show in your ‘Available Rewards’ list. Tap the reward you want to redeem, the points will be deducted from your total, and the reward will move to your ‘Saved Rewards’ list. When you’re ready to redeem your reward in a Topaz Restore store, go to your ‘Saved Rewards’ and tap on the one you want to use. You’ll get a unique QR code, which you then show to the cashier in store.

Ireland’s taxi driver check app allows you to check the license details of the vehicle of the taxi you are travelling in. You are able to see the details of the driver along with a photo of the authorised driver. The app allows you to forward these details without the photo to a friend. This provides reassurance to taxi customers that they are travelling safely and that there is a record of their trip. The app covers licenced taxis, hackneys, limos and PSVs throughout Ireland. There is a history section that stores all of your searches.

The app is easy to use; all you have to do is launch it on your phone, and then input one of the following:

- Ordinary vehicle registration number;
- Vehicle licence number (displayed on roof-sign and on door signs);
- Driver licence number (displayed on the ID card on the dashboard of the vehicle); or
- Scan the QR code on the vehicle which is located on a disc on both the front and rear
- windscreens.

If there are other apps you use throughout Dublin and Ireland for the same purpose we'd love to hear about them.
