At Tapadoo we love when new people join our team. Although Caoife is not entirely new! She did an internship in Tapadoo for six months in 2017 as part of her college course.

Here's a little info on Caoife:

> I studied Computer Science in UCC and had to do six months work placement during my third year, which was done in Tapadoo. While I was here I worked as an iOS developer and started off doing bug fixes and adding some new features to existing projects such as Slendertone and Hayfever. I mainly worked on the inhouse app Marty, almost starting it from scratch with a new UI design.

> I'm delighted for the opportunity to be back in Tapadoo. They are a great bunch of developers and it's a really good environment to get my teeth stuck into something exciting projects.

I'm sure Caoife will do very well in Tapadoo.

We wish her the best of luck in her new role.
