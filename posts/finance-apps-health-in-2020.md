The key takeaways from this report are:

- From January to June 2020, activity in investment apps saw and 88% growth in average sessions per day.

- Sessions for banking and payment apps combined increased by 26%, with the most notable being Japan at 142%, Germany at 40%, Turkey at 31%, and the US at 27%.
- Super-apps such as WeChat and KaKaoTalk, remain one of the top trends in Asia. WeChat and Alipay have exceeded one billion users and Zalo surpassed the 100 million mark.

The Fintech lending market is also on the increase. A growth rate of [9.1%](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/fintech-lending-industry-to-hit-291bn-in-2020/) is expected for Fintech lending in 2020.

Mobile payments and transactions are increasing because of the likes of PayPal, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, AliPay, PayPay and WeChat having all adapted to processing mobile payments and transactions. According to a [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-banking-market-trends?r=US&IR=T) study, half of credit unions surveyed saw a 56% increase in mobile wallet adoption and a 53% increase in mobile transactions. Also driving this increase is that more than [25% of consumers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200406005318/en/Global-Mobile-Payments-Market-2020---Growth) make weekly purchases from their mobile device and mobile payments are predicted to rise to [$138 billion in 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2020/03/01/fueled-by-increased-consumer-comfort-mobile-pay).

> "The impact the pandemic has had on banking and the increase in mobile digital services should not be underestimated. While the banking sector has been adapting to digital disruption for several years, COVID-19 is accelerating the transformation, opening up access and opportunity to millions of un- and under-banked consumers around the world."
