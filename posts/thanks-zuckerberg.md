3 Years back, Facebook purchased every app developer's favourite backend-as-a-service, parse.com.

Reports suggest that there were over 600,000 apps using the service. Essentially, 600,000 apps that had come to rely on it.

[Today, they've announced they are closing it down](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/).

For app developers, it's a kick in the parse.
