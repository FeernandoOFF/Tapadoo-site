Ireland is awash with Java developers. It was pretty much the language of choice for every government department, financial institution, telco, and even at one stage, startups.

I always thought that, in Dublin, once mobile development became popular, there would be many more Android developers than iOS developers. My logic went like this:

- There are lots of Java developers
- The tools are free
- The devices are cheap
- It's new and shiny and a new challenge

I really expected that in Ireland, we'd see lots of Java developers jump to becoming Android developers in this new, interesting market.

**But it doesn't seem to have happened. Why is that? Where _are_ they?**

I think there are a couple of reasons that may be contributing:

- Those who wanted a new challenge have already turned their attentions to something else like becoming Ruby developers.
- Many of these Java developers are now holding down high-paid positions with financial organisations or high daily rates as contractors. It's a nice existence, and there's no need for a change, thank you very much.
- Some people just aren't interested in new challenges.

But what about the rest? Surely, out there, there are some Java developers who've tinkered with Android, even put out a few indie apps, and would love to move from the cubicle farm into channeling their talents into mobile app development.

**Well, how about that?** We've [one such position](https://tapadoo.clinch.io/jobs/tapadoo-android-developer) open now.
