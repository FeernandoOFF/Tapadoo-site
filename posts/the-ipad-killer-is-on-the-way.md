If you're a journalist and you write a prophetic article on the iPad killer you are either looking for attention from trolls, or are dumb.

[I wrote about the "iPhone Killer" last year](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/2010/the-iphone-killer-is-on-the-way/). Nothing has changed, and all the arguments remain the same.

Move along now, nothing to see.

Related: I'd love to have a product that everyone writes is about to be trumped by a new "killer". Its a sure sign you're doing it right.
