Mobile devices have impacted the lives of everyone across the globe including the Irish. We spend more time on our mobile device than many other countries including the US. According to ComReg's 2019 Mobile Phone Consumer Experience [Survey](https://www.comreg.ie/comreg-issues-results-from-2019-mobile-phone-consumer-experience-survey/), we spend four and a half hours on our mobile phones daily. Whereas in the US, consumers spend on average [3 hours and 10 minutes](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-time-spent-with-mobile-2019) on their smartphone daily.

Of the 4½ hours spent on our mobiles each day only 10% of this time is for making calls. Social media dominates our time with an average of 64 minutes spent scrolling our news feeds. This is followed by streaming videos, where we spend an average of 53 minutes. We spend a further 47 minutes streaming music, followed by 32 minutes browsing the internet and 20 minutes sending and receiving emails. 

#### Mobile Consumer Report Ireland 2019

According to Deloitte's [Global Mobile Consumer Report 2019](https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/global-mobile-consumer-survey.html) 96% of Irish people have a mobile phone of which 91% are smartphones. We check our phones 50 times a day, although some admit to checking their phone over 200 times a day! And 21% will switch to a 5G network as soon as it is available.

On the usage of our phone, 85% use WhatsApp, 72% check work emails, 60% make calls at least daily and 33% monitor their fitness levels. While 66% of those surveyed are trying to limit their phone usage, 3 out of 10 indicated that the overuse of mobile phones has meant increased levels of distraction, not getting to bed on time and feeling like they constantly have to check their phone.

The most popular phone in Ireland is Samsung, followed by Apple but Huawei is the fastest growing.

#### Females Get More Value from their Mobile Phone

In Deloitte's [2019 Report](https://www.comreg.ie/media/2019/09/ComReg-Mobile-Consumer-Experience-Survey-Infographic05092019.pdf) females use their mobile phones more in almost every category. From monitoring their fitness to casting videos from their phone to the TV to controlling the music on their speaker, monitoring their health, controlling their in-car entertainment system and managing their healthcare, females surpassed males in all of these categories. Males had only slightly more usage in categories such as unlocking/locking their car or home, controlling home appliances and turning car heating and air-conditioning on/off remotely.
