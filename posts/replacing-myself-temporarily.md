I'm taking a little break from my post at Tapadoo. I'm going on maternity leave. But I need someone to hold the fort, and take the creative lead while I'm gone. If you're the type of person (or you know someone who is) who loves mobile, knows how to lead, and always asks "Why?" then don't hesitate to get in touch.

I love my job, and I want someone great to fill my role. I love coming to work everyday and working with our fantastic team and exciting projects. If you’re the type of person who loves working in a team, enjoys learning new things everyday and working under great conditions, then you’d be mad not to apply. In this role you’ll get to work with a the best people in the industry, worldwide brands, and new exciting products and companies. You’ll never be bored, and will be encouraged to voice your opinions, expand your ideas, and create the best experiences you can imagine.

Don't get me wrong, we're not looking for a cardboard cutout Orla.  I'm looking for someone to be part of the team, to be themselves and make the role their own, someone that I can learn from on my return, someone to make us better at what we do.

Have you ever looked at a "Maternity Leave" job listing and consciously or unconsciously thought they were looking for a female replacement? I'm not going to lie, I know I have. Yes, I am going on maternity leave and someone needs to take on my responsibilities, but in essence, this is a 6 month contract for the right person, whatever their gender or background, with a real prospect of more work in the future, we're always expanding, so this could very well be the perfect time to get your foot in the door.

**Additional Perks include:**

- Slack gif parties
- Poop Emoji pillow (optional)
- Cake Day
- Bringing Mike for lunch time walks
- Retina iMac + Cinema display
- Movie Nights
- Coffee club
- Lots of conversations about TV shows, movies, gaming, food and even real life sports ball.
- Tapadoo Swag
