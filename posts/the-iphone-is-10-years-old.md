Sheesh. Where did the time fly. At the 7 year mark, I wrote an article for the Loop Insight Magazine.  Some people thought it was an "iPhone Versus Android" piece. It wasn't. It was about iconic brands, and desirable products.

I predicted very early on in the iPhone's life that it would remain a leading iconic product for 20 years. That's a wild prediction.

We're 10 years in, and I stand by it.

For posterity, I published the [7 -year-mark article on Medium](https://medium.com/@dermdaly/but-its-not-an-actual-walkman-2fd98e201b0).  I hope you enjoy it.
