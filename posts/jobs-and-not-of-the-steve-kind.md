We're still expanding here at Tapadoo. So this morning, we're announcing 3 new positions. We're looking for a UX Specialist/Graphic Designer, another iOS Developer and an Account Manager.

One thing we try to stress: We find the right attitude with less experience is always better than more experience but the wrong attitude. So, if you read our job description and think "I can do that", get in touch. We'll give every application we receive due consideration, and we'll answer them all.

Head over to our [jobs page at Clinch](https://tapadoo.clinch.io/jobs), and get applying!
