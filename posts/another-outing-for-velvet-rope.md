Those of you who attended the appys last Thursday may have spotted the app being used to sign people in. Yes. Samsung gave "Velvet Rope" another outing.

The appys were a great night. Many of our good buddies from XCake were winners; Congratulations to Axonista, Redwind, and App Sandwich; good guys all 'round.
