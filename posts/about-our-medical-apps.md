At Tapadoo, our work is wide and varied. We've developed apps for everyone from small startups, up to the worlds largest brands, and we like to think, everything in between.

We've also worked in a diverse set of industries. Here's just some of the industries we've developed apps for

- Banking/Financial Services
- Telecoms
- The Sharing Economy
- Internet of Things
- Gaming
- Advertising
- Energy

The list could go on.

There is one area that we've done some very specialist work, and that's in the area of Healthcare. We've even had 2 apps approved as medical devices by the US Food and Drug Administration for our client, Slendertone. We've partnered with sport science companies and we've produced an app for a prominent Hay Fever specialist.

Given the specialist nature of healthcare apps, we've decided to put some emphasis on the work we've done to highlight our capabilities; so we now have a new section on our website dedicated to healthcare apps.

[Take a look around](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/medical-apps/). We hope you like it. If your business is in healthcare and you need an app developed, we've a dedicated contact form too on this page.

We hope to follow up with some posts and white papers about the work required to get your app approved as a medical device, but in the meantime, we'd love to hear your feedback.
