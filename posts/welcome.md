All blogs need to start with a welcome page. I don't know why, but it seems the most obvious thing to do. I guess it can be used to tell people what you will be writing about, etc.

Here's some things I may be writing about, in no particular order: software, Objective-C, Java, the software industry in Ireland, iPhone application development, living your life "in the cloud", photography, C, Apple, Linux, being a nerd, trying not to be a nerd, and cool new companies that are sprouting up.
