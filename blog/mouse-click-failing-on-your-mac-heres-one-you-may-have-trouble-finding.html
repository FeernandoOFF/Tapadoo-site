Here&#x27;s one you may have trouble finding</p><p>
So. This happened last week. It was pretty obscure, so I thought worth a post.

I had a little trouble with my mouse. Here&#x27;s the symptoms:

1\. Clicks were not registering. I could physically tap, or press the trackpad on my macbook air, and they simply weren&#x27;t having an effect. 2. Oddly, I was experiencing the exact same problem with my external trackpad.

So..what was the cause. Well here&#x27;s what I tried:

1\. I knew it had to be software related, and not a dodgy track pad; If it were faulty hardware one would work and another wouldn&#x27;t. 2. So I reset the PRAM - No effect. 3. So I reset the NVRAM - No effect.

Except on one occasion, just after reboot, it was working ok for a short period of time.

Then Jason hit on an idea. &quot;Disable bluetooth&quot; he said. So I disabled bluetooth; low and behold, the track pad started working. Re-enable, instantly stopped agin.

Then...we looked at the list of connected devices: Subtely, in bold there was a device not not on my desk &quot;Dermot&#x27;s Mouse&quot;.

So began an office search. A little while later, about 10 feet away, in a box, we found my old magic mouse. Upside down, with something on top of it, causing it&#x27;s button to be essentially pressed.

So. next time this happens to you. Check you list of devices. Do you know where they all are?
