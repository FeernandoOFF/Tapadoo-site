We&#x27;ve had our heads down for a couple of months. This is because we&#x27;ve been working on a project we&#x27;re very excited about. Now that our initial release is out the door, we&#x27;re happy to give out some information about it.

That project is **Firepit**. ![fp-logo-white](images/fp-logo-white.png &quot;fp-logo-white&quot;) **What is Firepit**? Firepit is

1. A web based framework
2. For bands going on tour...
3. ..which allows them to produce iPhone applications..
4. ..that are &quot;virtual tour programmes&quot;

We just got out the first Firepit release today: The App is &quot;[Ultravox - Return to Eden II](http://usefirepit.com/ultravox)&quot;, and it is on release on the app store worldwide.

We&#x27;re delighted that Ultravox are on board. They&#x27;ve been an avid supporter of the project for some weeks, getting behind the idea, and supplying some great exclusive content. A quick look over [Midge Ure&#x27;s Twitter stream](http://twitter.com/midgeure1) shows he&#x27;s being doing some beta testing, and bigging up the app.

Hope y&#x27;all like it.
