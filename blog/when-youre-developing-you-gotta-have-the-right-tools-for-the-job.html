When developing for mobile, its important that you are able to support all &quot;in the wild&quot; versions of operating systems and hardware you are targeting. Here at tapadoo, all iPhone projects are tested on iPod Touch, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4. We&#x27;re also updating our style guidelines for developers, and henceforth all supplied graphics will be required in standard and double-size to support the fancy new screens of iPhone 4. Older hardware is slower, so testing on these is essential to ensure that our clients&#x27; apps still give the best user experience possible. We also now have to consider iPad, and the new possibilities it raises with extra screen real estate.

Phew. Luckily, we&#x27;re stocked up well to support all this; we took a serious delivery this morning. Check out the testing pool. ![IMG_0748](images/IMG_07481-1024x768.jpg &quot;IMG_0748&quot;)
