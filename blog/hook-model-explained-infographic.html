So you&#x27;ve more than likely heard about the [Hook Model](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/) for creating habits with apps, or more importantly, turning your app into a [habit-forming product](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/). That&#x27;s the purpose of the Hook Model. It helps product owners identify if their app can become a habit for users and describes the process of how to get users hooked on your app.

So what is the Hook Model by Nir Eyal?

Nir Eyal&#x27;s Hook Model is how you build [habit-forming products](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/). It&#x27;s based on behavioural psychology and applied by many businesses including app development.

Ever wonder why you are hooked on social media?

You can thank the [Hook Model](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/) for that.

### The Hook Model by Nir Eyal Explained

The Hook Model by Nir Eyal is a four-step process of trigger, action, variable reward and investment. It has been designed to help businesses build habit-forming products. The focus here for product development is usability design - how product design drives specific behaviours.

It starts with an experience that causes the habit which results in the action. The experience is caused by a trigger. These triggers are both internal and external.

Then you introduce a variable reward that entice&#x27;s investment. The good thing about a variable reward is that it impacts [retention rates](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/user-retention-tactics-mobile-app-marketing/).

The investment taken is aimed at improving the service for the next round of the Hook Model. Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, learning to use new features; these are the types of investments users make to improver their experience.

If the experience within your app takes users through this process repeatedly, it turns your app into a habit-forming product. In other words, an app that users keep coming back to.

We&#x27;ve written about it in more depth in another [post](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/) but for the purposes of this post we&#x27;ve summed everything up in the infographic below.
