The new windows 7 phone is upon us. Finally there&#x27;s an &quot;iPhone killer&quot;!!!

Ehhhhh. No.

There will be an iPhone killer. But it&#x27;s not going be today tomorrow. The iPhone is just far too advanced of any competition.

Why? Apple have one thing _in spades_ that no other computer or handset manufacturer has: **Taste.**

This seems to be lost on most non-iPhone owners. The arguments for the competition are usually about specifications. That&#x27;s just silly. Most people don&#x27;t know _megabytes_ from _kilohertz_ so don&#x27;t give a monkeys about specifications. I&#x27;ve often listened to arguments about x device having a faster processor, or doing background processing. But these people never ever do what almost every new iPhone owner does : tell me how much they love their phones. **Try it**: borrow a buddies iPhone and play with it. 2 things will happen : you&#x27;ll say &quot;yeah...it is lovely&quot; and your buddy will start to twitch; we don&#x27;t like letting our iPhones out of our reach for too long. You don&#x27;t get that reaction from a new Sony Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung or Android for that matter. In fact the most common utterance I hear from nokia owners are

&gt; &quot;look I just want to make calls and send texts&quot;

not

&gt; &quot;I love this phone&quot;

Every time I try out a new other vendors phone I usually finding myself not liking it. sometimes the annoyances are subtle like just _slighlty_ too slow to respond or jerky scrolling. That just tells me that someone in the company, high up, with the final say said

&gt; **&quot;it&#x27;s good enough.&quot;**

That&#x27;s understandable; getting the last 5% so that something goes from &quot;good enough&quot; to &quot;perfect&quot; may well take ages or cost the earth. But thankfully, Apple don&#x27;t do &quot;good enough&quot;. They take the &quot;it&#x27;s gotta be perfect&quot; approach as a matter of course. And for that...we have the iPhone

So when&#x27;s that iPhone killer coming? Consider this: for a few years, every new mp3 player was being dubbed an _&quot;iPod killer&quot;_. It hasn&#x27;t happened yet and nobody even writes about iPod killers anymore.

So far the only iPhone killers have been, well...newer iPhones.

It won&#x27;t last forever; it never does. Walkmans were toppled; iPhones will be, but it will take new technology that I can&#x27;t imagine right now. iPhone could easily dominate for a decade......
