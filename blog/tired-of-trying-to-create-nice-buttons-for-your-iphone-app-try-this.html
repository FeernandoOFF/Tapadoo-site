**Flat iPhone buttons as offered in Interface builder suck**. They don&#x27;t look nice.

There&#x27;s the option of using Three20 to get good looking buttons. Its an option, but frankly, it feels a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. You end up with a large addition to your code, just for nice buttons. OK, you could go to the trouble of stripping out what you don&#x27;t need, but that again is more work.

All iPhone developers know about UIGlassButton - Its an undocumented API for making nice looking buttons, that exists only on the simulator and not on the iPhone itself. Why couldn&#x27;t we just have that for iPhone OS? I dunno, but its not there.

At some point in the past, I came across a nice snippet of code that used undocumented techniques for creating a glass button, and then saving the image to disk. This could then be used as a background to a &quot;custom button&quot;, producing the nice glass buttons I&#x27;ve been looking for. I think it was [schwa](http://twitter.com/schwa) on twitter; Nice. Full credit where it&#x27;s due.

So, building upon this, I&#x27;ve thrown together a simple single-screen app for creating the images for glass buttons using that technique. Basically, it allows you set the RGB values, and the size. Hitting &quot;Save&quot; writes the pngs to the application&#x27;s documents directory. Now, you&#x27;ll have two png files, which you can use as images in custom buttons. Hey presto. Very simple UIGlassButtons. Here&#x27;s a screen shot:
