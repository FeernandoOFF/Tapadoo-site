Clutch Announced the [2019 leading developers](https://clutch.co/press-releases/announces-2019-leading-developers-across-variety-technology-focus-areas) across a variety of technology focus areas and we’ve been named a ‘[Top Wearables App Developer](https://clutch.co/app-developers/wearables)’!

[Clutch](https://clutch.co) is the leading B2B ratings and reviews agency based in Washington DC. They specialise in researching companies globally on their quality of work, market presence and most importantly, their clients’ experiences. 

### Independent Reveiw

Clutch doesn’t just take a company’s word for it. Instead, they take the extra step towards providing accurate information on each company by independently interviewing clients over the phone.

Once the information has been gathered it&#x27;s published on the company’s [Clutch profile](https://clutch.co/profile/tapadoo). This offers a completely honest and non-biased view of the company.

So, it’s a pleasure to have received a [Clutch Leader Award](https://clutch.co/press-releases/announces-2019-leading-developers-across-variety-technology-focus-areas) this month and to be recognised as a [Top Wearables App Develope](https://clutch.co/app-developers/wearables)_[r](https://clutch.co/app-developers/wearables)_. We’ve now been listed among the leading wearable app developers from across the globe.

_**We&#x27;re a &#x27;top wearables app developer&#x27; for 2019**_

### How did we achieve this wearable technology award?

We couldn’t have done this without the commitment and hard work of the Tapadoo team and also the long-standing relationship we have with our client [Bio-Medical Research Limited](https://www.bmr.ie). We have both been committed to the ongoing excellence of [Slendertone Connect](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/portfolio/slendertone-connect-app/). [Slendertone Connect](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/portfolio/slendertone-connect-app/) is a wearable technology example that&#x27;s setting the trend for other such wearable technology.

Bio-Medical Research Limited are innovators in their field and we&#x27;re very happy to have shared this journey with them. They continuously trust us to deliver the best app experience for their clients and the proof is in the recognition we have received from both them and Clutch. And also, in the numerous client success stories with the [Slendertone Connect](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/portfolio/slendertone-connect-app/) abs belt.

We&#x27;re grateful to all our clients who took the time out of their busy schedule to give an in-depth interview on how we perform as a company. And for them all to give us a 5-star rating.

Looking forward to building on our continued success and to add further reviews and 5-star ratings to our [Clutch profile](https://clutch.co/profile/tapadoo).
