<p class="blog-text text-justify">It has served us well over the last 6 years. However as we continue to grow, we’ve also began to outgrow our beloved beachball logo. Through discussion and design we wanted to explore how the company has grown, and make something that represented both our internal culture, and our clients. We&#x27;re not in the mindset that lots of companies are rebranding so we should too. This was something that came about very naturally.

<p class="blog-text text-justify">Over the last few months we&#x27;ve held a series of branding workshops internally. This was not however &quot;design by committee&quot;. It regularly involved challenging each other on how we perceive our company, what are our hopes for the future, looking at other brands, and picking apart the very essence of who we want to be and why. A small number of staff members attended the workshops, all workshops were very much based around conversations, and most included some kind of practical exercise to initiate conversations. Through this series of workshops, we were able to define our core values as a company, and a mission statement we could stand over. <img src="/Tapadoo-site/images/Image-1-300x225.jpg" class="my-3"/></p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">We began to sketch potential ideas based on the reoccurring themes in the workshops. Initially there were a lot of ideas, lots of variation, but from the many sketches and ideas reoccurring shapes, and representations came through.<a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-17-at-1.49.24-p.m..png"></a></p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">As these things go, we landed on two strong but different ideas. We began to pick them apart, and do anything we could to make them stronger. We refined the ideas and began to apply type and colour. There was only one limit to work within: We are keeping our name “Tapadoo”. And one open question to be explored: Should we keep any reference to the old logo?</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We decided that a subtle nod to our past was a good thing, we are extremely proud of or history, and in that vein we decided to included the colour orange in the logo as a reference to this.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">With that, one idea won out, and we are proud to say that from today, we will be living under a newly branded Tapadoo, one that represents our ethos both internally &amp; externally.</p>
