We’re looking for someone to join the Tapadoo team in a QA role. We’ve been advertising this role for a few weeks now, and we’ve been somewhat disappointed with the quality of responses we’ve had.

And it’s all our fault.

You know why? Because what we’ve been saying inside the four Tapadoo walls and what we’ve been saying to the outside world didn’t match.

Internally we’ve been saying (and meaning), “We think the right personality traits and the right attitude and enthusiasm are more important than how much specific experience the person has.”

But what we said on our job post was “You’ll bring your relevant QA experience to the role, blah, blah, etc. and so on.”

Some lazy corporate speak got in the way of what we really meant to communicate.

We want someone who wants to make things better. In this case we want someone who wants to make our work better. We want attitude, attention to detail and a willingness to dig in.

It’s a shame we didn’t say that in the first place.

Something else has been on our minds. We value diversity at Tapadoo. We work hard to create a co-operative, collaborative environment that respects and values the contributions of a broad range of people.

And we know that research shows that frequently when men look at a list of desired qualifications and experience in a job post, if they see that they meet 60% of them they apply for the job. Women on the other hand often don’t apply unless they meet all 100% of the qualifications.

We know that, and yet we still wrote a job post that suggested that matching our laundry list of qualifications and experience was the most important thing.

We’ve rewritten our [job post](https://clinch.io/companies/tapadoo/jobs/qa-specialist-mobile-apps &quot;QA Role&quot;).

If you’re thinking “Hey, I could do that, but I don’t have enough \[\[anything\]\]”, drop us a line. We’d like to talk to you.

It’s nice if you have some direct experience, but it’s not the most important thing to us.

We think the immortal Meatloaf was right when he said,“2 out of 3 ain’t bad.”

(In fact, we think that sometimes 1 out of 3 is pretty damn great.)
