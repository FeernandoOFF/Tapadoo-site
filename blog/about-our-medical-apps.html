At Tapadoo, our work is wide and varied. We&#x27;ve developed apps for everyone from small startups, up to the worlds largest brands, and we like to think, everything in between.

We&#x27;ve also worked in a diverse set of industries. Here&#x27;s just some of the industries we&#x27;ve developed apps for

- Banking/Financial Services
- Telecoms
- The Sharing Economy
- Internet of Things
- Gaming
- Advertising
- Energy

The list could go on.

There is one area that we&#x27;ve done some very specialist work, and that&#x27;s in the area of Healthcare. We&#x27;ve even had 2 apps approved as medical devices by the US Food and Drug Administration for our client, Slendertone. We&#x27;ve partnered with sport science companies and we&#x27;ve produced an app for a prominent Hay Fever specialist.

Given the specialist nature of healthcare apps, we&#x27;ve decided to put some emphasis on the work we&#x27;ve done to highlight our capabilities; so we now have a new section on our website dedicated to healthcare apps.

[Take a look around](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/medical-apps/). We hope you like it. If your business is in healthcare and you need an app developed, we&#x27;ve a dedicated contact form too on this page.

We hope to follow up with some posts and white papers about the work required to get your app approved as a medical device, but in the meantime, we&#x27;d love to hear your feedback.
