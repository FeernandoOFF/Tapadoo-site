Got an **Apple Keyboard™**? Disgruntled with the way the PageUp/PageDown/Home/End buttons only move the screen and not the cursor? Well, gruntle no more with this handy tip! _(Windows users can feel smug in the knowledge that their keyboards have always had this functionality\*.)_

In ~/Library/, create a directory called KeyBindings. In this directory, create a file called DefaultKeyBinding.dict, and enter the following bit of crunchy magic goodness:

{
&quot;UF729&quot; = (&quot;moveToBeginningOfDocument:&quot;,&quot;setMark:&quot;); 
&quot;UF72B&quot; = (&quot;moveToEndOfDocument:&quot;,&quot;setMark:&quot;);
&quot;UF72C&quot; = (&quot;pageUp:&quot;,&quot;setMark:&quot;); 
&quot;UF72D&quot; = (&quot;pageDown:&quot;,&quot;setMark:&quot;);
}

Restart any Cocoa application that that uses Cocoa Text System, and the new keybinding will take effect in that application, as if by magic!

**CAVEAT:** XCode overrides the default text keyboard bindings, so you&#x27;ll need to update the keyboard bindings manually.

Goto Preferences / KeyBindings / Text Key Bindings, and update the following actions with the relevant keystrokes:

&gt; Mode to Beginning of Document: ↖  
&gt; Mode to End of Document: ↘  
&gt; Page Down: ↡  
&gt; Page Up: ↟

Now, you have a wonderful keyboard with really actually usable and useful navigation keys!

_\* Shame about the rest of the Windows user experience, haha._
