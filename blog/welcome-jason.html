Today I can announce that we&#x27;ve added a new member to the team. And with a new team member comes new capabilities. Jason Connery joins tapadoo where he&#x27;s going to have a primary focus on Android App development.

Jason brings a wealth of server side API development experience to the company which will further strengthen our offerings; We all know that Apps are rarely standalone; A server side element is often required; Sometimes our clients have existing APIs, often we build them for them.

When not writing code, Jason is a keen gamer, reader and movie watcher. [![](images/jason-246x300.png &quot;jason&quot;)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/jason.png) Find him on twitter as [@jasonconnery](http://twitter.com/jasonconnery). I hope you will join me in wishing Jason all the best.
