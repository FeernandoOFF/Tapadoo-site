<p class="blog-text text-justify">When I see &quot;we&#x27;d like to allow users to message each other&quot;, here&#x27;s 10 questions that reel off, each leading to further features:</p>
<ul>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Do you want to know if the message is successfully delivered?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Do you want to know if the message has been read?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Would you like to send photos?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">When the recipient receives a photo, should tapping on it go full screen?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">What about videos?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Do you want group chat?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">So, we&#x27;ll need the concept of chat admins, add/edit/remove people from the chat?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Probably group chat titles?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Do you want to show unread counts?</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">Will users need avatars?</li>
</ul>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">This list could go on, but typically all of the above is just expected.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">This is before you get into the <em>responsibility</em> of running a messaging system. Your server better be robust. It better be scalable.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">How are you going to handle harassment? (If you provide a message service someone <strong>will</strong> be abusive to someone else on it). Now we better consider a block/report feature. (And you&#x27;re going to need a process for dealing with someone who has reported something).</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The chats may need to be encrypted; you shouldn&#x27;t have access. If you do, you may need to prepare your business processes for dealing with enquiries from law-enforcement.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">And after all of this, be prepared for people to leave your messaging system quickly. If you app isn&#x27;t primarily a messaging app, once a real connection is made through your service, people will naturally migrate to where they do the bulk of their messaging - Whastapp/iMessage.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So, before considering messaging as a feature, you may want to consider what messaging actually entails.</p></section></div> </main><footer class="p-10 bg-[#F5F5F590] text-[#A09893] "><div class="app-container footer"><div><img src="/_next/static/media/tapadoo-large-logo.b51a8a63.png" alt="Tapadoo logo" class="w-full max-w-[120px] cursor-pointer grayscale"/><div class="my-4"><p>26-28 Strand Street Great, Dublin 1 </p><a href="mailto:enquiries@tapadoo.com">enquiries@tapadoo.com</a></div><a href="tel:3531123456">+353 1 123456</a></div><div><span class="footer-title">Links</span><a class="link link-hover" href="/tapadoo/contact">Privacy Policy</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/tapadoo/contact">Support</a></div><div><span class="footer-title">Company</span><a class="link link-hover" href="/tapadoo/about">About us</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/tapadoo/careers">Careers</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/apps/costs">Pricing</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/blog">Blog</a></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"\"...and we'd like to allow users to message each other\"","date":"2019-11-11","content":"\nHere's a common request we find in an early stage client conversation:\n\n\"..and we'd like to allow users to message each other\"\n\nIf ever there was a statement that hides complexity it's this one.\n\nMessaging sounds simple right?\n\nUser A send a Message to User B.
