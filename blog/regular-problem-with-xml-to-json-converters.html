Here at tapadoo, we&#x27;ve done a number of apps which communicate with back end data servers. Typically this means a RESTful API with JSON or XML payloads. There&#x27;s one issue we&#x27;ve come across on a number of projects, where we&#x27;re dealing with an existing Web API which is presenting the payloads in JSON. The problem is where arrays are incorrectly serialized in certain cases. Specifically we&#x27;ve seen:

- When an array has more than 1 entry, it is serialized correctly
- When the array has only 1 entry, it is serialized not as an array, but as a single dictionary.

**Firstly, lets explain why this has occurred** If you consider the following XML:

&lt;team&gt;
    &lt;employee&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Joe&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Bloggs&lt;/surname&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
  &lt;employee&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Jane&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;surname&gt;Doe&lt;/surname&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
&lt;/team&gt;

A typical XML to JSON converter will convert this as follows:

{
  team:{
    employee:\[
      {
        name:&#x27;Joe&#x27;,
        surname:&#x27;Bloggs&#x27;
      },
      {
        name:&#x27;Jane&#x27;,
        surname:&#x27;Doe&#x27;
      }
    \]
  }
}

I.e It is converted to a Dictionary, with a key called &#x27;team&#x27; whose value is a Dictionary, with a key called &#x27;employee&#x27; which is an array of Dictionaries (with keys of &#x27;name&#x27; and &#x27;surname&#x27;).

Great. However if the XML was a team with a single entry:

&lt;team&gt;
    &lt;employee&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Joe&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Bloggs&lt;/surname&gt;
  &lt;/employee&gt;
&lt;/team&gt;

The XML to JSON converter has no context on Employee. It has now way of knowing that this is potentially a repeating group (especially if it has no XSD to consult), so it converts the XML to the following JSON:

{
  team:{
    employee:{
      name:&#x27;Joe&#x27;,
      surname:&#x27;Bloggs&#x27;
    }
  }
}

So, this is now a Dictionary, with a key called &#x27;team&#x27; whose value is a dictionary with a key called &#x27;employee&#x27; whose value is a Dictionary.

The problem here is when we go to parse, we expect the value of &#x27;employee&#x27; to be an array (which it isn&#x27;t), and this can lead to problems in the code.

And..due to Objective-C loose approach to type, the following code will run: `NSArray *array = [teamDict objectForKey:@&quot;employee&quot;];`

In those cases where there team has a number of employees, the above code works fine, and the pointer, array stores an array. In those cases where a team as a single employee, the above code runs, however the pointer, array will actually point to a NSDictionary. So the following code (for example) `int numEntries = [array count];` Will sometimes work, and sometimes lead to a runtime error, which on iPhone will manifest itself as a crash.

**So how do we fix this?** Well, if you have control over the server side, the simple question is to fix it in the first place. Note: This is a common problem with JAXB, a popular java XML binding mechanism often used in REST services written in Java. We&#x27;ve come across some examples on how to work around it [here](http://forums.netbeans.org/post-68036.html) and [here](http://jersey.576304.n2.nabble.com/Single-Element-Arrays-and-JSON-td5532105.html).

If you have no control over this, you may be able to handle this in your Objective-C code. Here&#x27;s some sample code we&#x27;ve started to use; It checks the data type at runtime, and if necessary, converts it to a single element array

+(NSArray \*) getArrayFromJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary \*)parent 
               forKey:(NSString \*)key {
  id obj = \[parent objectForKey:key\];
  if(\[obj isKindOfClass:\[NSArray class\]\]) {
    return obj;
  }
  if(\[obj isEqual:\[NSNull null\]\]) {
    NSLog(@&quot;Warning: object for key %@ is null&quot;, key);
    // Return an empty array
    return \[\[\[NSArray alloc\] init\] autorelease\];
  }
  NSLog(@&quot;Warning object for key %@ is of type %@&quot;,
        key, \[\[obj class\] description\]);
  NSArray \*ret = \[NSArray arrayWithObject:obj\];
  return ret;
}
