&gt; **&quot;Well, just because people are vocal about it, doesn&#x27;t mean everyone hates it, we should probably run a survey and check analytics&quot;**  
&gt;   
&gt; &quot;The findings are in! Loads of people hate it, some like it. If we get rid of it we&#x27;ll annoy 7.24% of our audience&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The retention team don&#x27;t like the sound of that figure...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;We better make it configurable on the account so.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;On the _account_, or on the _profile_?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What if, Mom likes the auto play feature, but Dad hates it?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;ahhhhh&quot;

&gt; **&quot;Hey everyone, we&#x27;re going to make the auto play feature configurable!&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Wait. When you say &#x27;auto play feature&#x27; do you mean the feature where you&#x27;re finished watching an episode and the next one auto plays?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;YES!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;NO!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Huh?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Well, I&quot;m talking about the feature where I&#x27;m trying to _browse_, and it auto plays trailers&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Well, _I&#x27;m_ talking about when the next episode auto plays&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Oh&quot;  

&gt; **&quot;OK, We better make both of them configurable&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Someone call the UX team, and find out the best way to do it&quot;  
&gt; &quot;And let the database team know we&#x27;ll need a new flag on the user profile table&quot;

&gt; **&quot;A new flag? What will be put in as default for the hundreds of millions of existing profiles?&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Let&#x27;s meet up to discuss this&quot;  

&gt; **&quot;Who&#x27;s responsible for the API? They&#x27;re going to need to make a change to carry the new flag&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;you mean flags.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Yes. You&#x27;re right &#x27;flags&#x27;&quot;

&gt; **&quot;The API team have been in touch; they&#x27;ve made the new change to the login profile, they want to know should they change the POST to profile to change the value?&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;What for?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;To _save_ the user&#x27;s preference&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Oh, yeah. We better get that done too&quot;  

&gt; **&quot;How are the front end team doing on the UI?&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Awaiting designs&quot;

&gt; **&quot;The UI team are done. The new switch is in the profile screen, it&#x27;s working great on chrome and safari. Just have a minor fix for Firefox to complete&quot;. It&#x27;ll be in QA by tomorrow.**  
&gt; &quot;Right, how are the Apple TV team doing?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Oh, they&#x27;ve a scheduled release in 1 month, so this change is on their backlog&quot;  

&gt; **Have the carousel team wrote the code to not auto play?**  
&gt; yep!

&gt; **&quot;What about the LG TV Team?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What about The Android Team&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The iPad Team?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The Roku Team?&quot;**
