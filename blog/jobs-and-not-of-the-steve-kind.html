And not of the Steve kind.</p><p>
We&#x27;re still expanding here at Tapadoo. So this morning, we&#x27;re announcing 3 new positions. We&#x27;re looking for a UX Specialist/Graphic Designer, another iOS Developer and an Account Manager.

One thing we try to stress: We find the right attitude with less experience is always better than more experience but the wrong attitude. So, if you read our job description and think &quot;I can do that&quot;, get in touch. We&#x27;ll give every application we receive due consideration, and we&#x27;ll answer them all.

Head over to our [jobs page at Clinch](https://tapadoo.clinch.io/jobs), and get applying!
