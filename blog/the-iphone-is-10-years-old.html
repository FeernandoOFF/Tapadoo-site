Sheesh. Where did the time fly. At the 7 year mark, I wrote an article for the Loop Insight Magazine.  Some people thought it was an &quot;iPhone Versus Android&quot; piece. It wasn&#x27;t. It was about iconic brands, and desirable products.

I predicted very early on in the iPhone&#x27;s life that it would remain a leading iconic product for 20 years. That&#x27;s a wild prediction.

We&#x27;re 10 years in, and I stand by it.

For posterity, I published the [7 -year-mark article on Medium](https://medium.com/@dermdaly/but-its-not-an-actual-walkman-2fd98e201b0).  I hope you enjoy it.
