In just over a decade, Tapadoo has rapidly established itself as one of the best development teams in the industry, both in Ireland and beyond. We specialise in creating mobile apps that thrive in today’s [digital age.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jakepryszlak/2019/02/13/top-tips-from-a-leading-industry-leader-on-how-to-create-an-app-for-the-digital-age/#4d4af0706d7a) Our range of UI/UX, support, testing, and modernisation skills perfectly complement any mobile strategy or design need that a client might have.

Tapadoo has recently been selected as one of the world’s best app development companies by leading B2B research and reviews agency [Clutch.](https://clutch.co/) Clutch diligently studies the market presence, industry experience, and client feedback of companies in analysing the overall performance, reputation, and quality of firms. 

They recently published a ranking of the leading app developers in the field globally. This ranking features [Tapadoo](https://clutch.co/profile/tapadoo) standing heads and shoulders above hundreds of our competitors.

Knowing that such a data-driven methodology backs our talent feels great.

#### **Reward**

With hard work and dedication comes reward, and we certainly feel like we’ve been rewarded with compelling 5-star reviews from our clients. Our dedication to app development has firmly established us as a leader in the industry.

It’s an honour and a privilege to work with these amazing clients, [PrePayPower](https://www.prepaypower.ie/), [DHL](https://www.logistics.dhl/ie-en/home.html), [Bio-Medical Research](https://www.bmr.ie/) and many other clients who we’ve had long-standing relationships with. The fact that our clients come back to us every time they have a new idea is testament to the work we do in Tapadoo.

In one 5-star review of our work, our client said, “Tapadoo is one of our best partnership engagements for software programming. **A genuine desire to understand what the client wants to achieve makes Tapadoo stand out from the competition**”.

Another client said; “**The team provided excellent ideas and suggestions throughout the project**, demonstrating their hands-on, dedicated management style”. “**They were on time, on budget, and delivered exactly what they said they would.** There was great value in them showing us what their vision was prior to actually creating it as we knew what we were going to get. **They’re very involved and easy to deal with, and always there when we need them**.”

#### **It doesn’t stop there**

Clutch’s sister companies, The Manifest and Visual Objects, echoed these sentiments about our team’s capabilities and promise. Both firms individually reviewed and came to similar conclusions about the sterling quality of our talent.

Business news website The Manifest named Tapadoo on its list of top [Android app developers](https://themanifest.com/app-development/android/companies). They cite our key involvement in spearheading strategic growth for customers. And portfolio curation platform [Visual Objects](https://visualobjects.com/app-development/top-mobile-app-development-companies) now lets our work speak for itself. They showcase the design and project management successes that we’ve accumulated since our founding.

#### **What’s next?**

What will the next ten years of challenges, clients, and creativity do for Tapadoo and our customers? We know that with the incredible team and support around us, anything is possible. We are always on the lookout to collaborate with business partners to help bring their ideas to life.

If you’re interested in working with one of the worlds leading mobile app development companies, please feel free to drop us a line [here](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/contact/). We’d love to help you to rethink and refresh your company’s mobile and digital experiences.
