&gt; No it isn&#x27;t.

If you&#x27;re a journalist and you write a prophetic article on the iPad killer you are either looking for attention from trolls, or are dumb.

[I wrote about the &quot;iPhone Killer&quot; last year](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/2010/the-iphone-killer-is-on-the-way/). Nothing has changed, and all the arguments remain the same.

Move along now, nothing to see.

Related: I&#x27;d love to have a product that everyone writes is about to be trumped by a new &quot;killer&quot;. Its a sure sign you&#x27;re doing it right.
