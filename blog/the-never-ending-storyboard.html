After a hard few weeks of development, some of the projects we&#x27;ve been working on are almost complete. Seeing first hand the evolution of an app, from the whiteboard to having it run in the palm of your hand, has been a very rewarding experience to say the least. Not without its challenges I must add, but that&#x27;s what makes things interesting! I spend most of the last two weeks working through bugs, testing the various apps on a multitude of screen sizes, and constantly looking out for errors or inconsistencies, and fixing them when possible!

Last week I started to foray into some iOS development, and have been trying to get to grips with Objective-C. It&#x27;s enlightening to see how two different platforms handle similar obstacles. Both sides, Android and iOS have their merits, but it&#x27;s still early days for me to critique either! I think the StoryBoard utility of xCode is a very valuable asset in a iOS developer&#x27;s arsenal. It really gives you an improved sense of the overall flow and &quot;Bigger-Picture&quot; of your app. For all those whom haven&#x27;t experienced it, basically it lays out all the screens of the applications, their relationships to one another, and their individual components. Having this laid out in the open gives you an excellent perspective of your position in the development cycle.

XCode StoryBoard

I do still find myself writing some Java while in xCode, but old habits do die hard!

That&#x27;s about it for now!

And just for fun, if you&#x27;d like to see just how close the DART comes to our apartment, have a look at the clip linked below!

All the best, Kevin.
