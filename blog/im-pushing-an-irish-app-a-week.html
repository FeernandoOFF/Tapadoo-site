There&#x27;s lots of great app review sites out there. Some are very popular, and getting a mention can really help your iPhone App sales. But getting on them can be difficult, and I&#x27;ve even heard stories of how these sites are asking for payment to be featured. This may be how the world works, but I think this should at least be made explicit. Otherwise, the review or blog entry isn&#x27;t quite as it seems. Is it?

But, there&#x27;s a bunch of talented Irish iPhone developers who have released their own titles. Most of them hang out on [XCake.org](http://www.xcake.org/) which is a user group for iPhone developers in Ireland, both North and South.

I&#x27;m gonna mention one such app per week in the hope that these apps may hit a wider audience than they already have. It will showcase some of the great work being done by Irish developers.

This week&#x27;s push is [Pocket Universe](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=306916838&amp;mt=8) (App Store Link). From Dublin based [Craic Design](http://www.craicdesign.com/).

Right, I gotta admit, I&#x27;m not a astronomy guy. I tend not to stargaze, but given I knew this was an Irish App, I decided to give it a whirl, and was pleasantly surprised by this app. This has genuinely one of the most innovative uses for the accelerometer and GPS I&#x27;ve seen.

From the off, it decides where you are using the GPS, and maps the sky as it is, where you are right now. Handy - A wysiwyg view of the sky so to speak. But, here&#x27;s where it gets cool; tilt your iPhone upwards towards the sky, and the viewport moves accordingly, so that what you are looking at in the sky is what you are seeing on your phone. A cool feature - And great for showing the kids.

Of course, you may want to look at the sky from a different perspective, or from a different time of day (yes...the sky is more interesting by night!). It can do this too. Simply jump to a another place and time at the tap of a button, and it takes you there (and then!). Zooming in and out is supported through the now familiar pinch movements. Nice.

All in all, a great little educational app - If you&#x27;re into astronomy, definitely take a look at this app. If you&#x27;re not, its worth a look for its tilting functionality alone!
