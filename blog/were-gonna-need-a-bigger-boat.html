iPhone development company WLTM iOS developers for mutual friendship, maybe more. We have a healthy pipeline and are looking for people who share our interest in all things Apple. Our ideal candidate would have some if not all of the following:

- Proven track record in releasing iOS applications
- Have at least gained certification at beginner of special ops in modern warfare 2
- Keen eye for detail
- Have never used the phrase &quot;Its good enough, lets ship it as is&quot;
- Be in a possession of a full clean, collection of Apple stuff

Or...if you&#x27;re the best iOS developer you know, we want to hear from you.

Get in touch with Dermot. If you don&#x27;t know how, you&#x27;ve stumbled at the first hurdle.
