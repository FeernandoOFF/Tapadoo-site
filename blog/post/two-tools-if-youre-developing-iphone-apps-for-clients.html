planning on developing apps, particularly for clients. These are just as important for any sort of iPhone app development, but they are very useful for interacting and collaborating with customers.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle ">Balsamiq</h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><a class="text-primary " href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq mockups</a> from Balsamiq Studios plain and simple rocks. What is it? It is a very rapid prototyping tools for UI and User Experiences. They&#x27;ve added specific iPhone stencils into the product so you can create mockups really, really quickly. Why do I like it? Lots of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Its runs everywhere. Its an Adobe Air application, which though is not native to Mac, it runs nicely on the desktop. But, they&#x27;ve also got an edition that runs in a web page, so you can deploy it on your wiki, or any other collaborative web server you may use. They&#x27;ve even got a hosted edition which you can play with for free (go <a class="text-primary " href="http://www.balsamiq.com/demos/mockups/Mockups.html">here</a>, have a play)</p>
</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Doing up stuff is <em>fast</em>. It is genuinely as quick as using a pen and paper. Just last week I was working on a proposal; the client had given me his ideas, and I already formed my opinion on how it would look. I mailed him back my response as a bulleted point list (It was a small project!). He wasn&#x27;t convinced. So...I spent a bit longer, and did up a couple of pages of a proposal. I used mockups to illustrate my ideas. Without spending too much time, I had gone from a boring e-mail response, to a professional, well thought out one, which immediately struck a chord with the client.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It is focused on function rather than detail. I really like this. It produces mockups that look like they are hand drawn. It avoids details like colour, animation etc. This means when working with the client we can focus on what the app does ( not &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t that button be bluer?&quot;). We get across high level ideas, get them across well, and by being low on a lot of details, it means we can get more feedback with the client. I love the phrase Balsamiq use themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">A low fidelity look which encourages hones feedback. We call it &quot;<em>a look no-one is afraid to criticize</em>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">
<p class="blog-text text-justify">They have an agile approach to their product; They update their application on a regular basis, based on feedback taken through GetSatisfaction</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Enough of my rambling; Here&#x27;s a mockup.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><img src="/Tapadoo-site/images/mockup.png" class="my-3 mx-auto"/></p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle ">iPhone Application Sketch Book</h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Next is...an actual sketch book. Its available on amazon, but you can find details about it on <a class="text-primary " href="http://www.mobilesketchbook.com">www.mobilesketchbook.com</a>. I think this is a great one for grabbing ideas, or scribbling down initial design thoughts. I like this because it is a low-tech answer; Each page is lined graph paper, with a full-size image of on iPhone on it. The screen area is blank, so you can draw on it to capture your app ideas. <img src="/Tapadoo-site/images/l-800-606-c2b55ee2-926d-4b31-90a3-ff27796e91c3.jpeg" class="my-3 mx-auto"/> You can have this in your laptop bag, and use it when an idea comes to you. (when travelling, for example).</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Having this along at a client meeting is great. It shows the client that you are doing this often, and you are serious about capturing the ideas</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I know there&#x27;s others out there, based around Powerpoint or Keynote, but frankly, these two are my favourites right now.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If you&#x27;ve other tips, please leave a comment with your favourite tools for iPhone design and development.</p>
