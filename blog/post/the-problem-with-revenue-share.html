<p class="blog-text text-justify">If we work together on <em>your idea</em>, I&#x27;ve to put a great deal of effort into the software development. Software development is complex, detailed and a good programmer has very real talent, which has taken many years to hone. (I&#x27;ve never met a great programmer who wasn&#x27;t already at it from around 12 years old). Experienced programmers know that the <a class="text-primary " href="http://www.contrast.ie/blog/there-are-no-small-changes/">devil is in the detail</a></p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So lets look at the proposition from another perspective. When did your idea come to you? While lying awake trying to go asleep? Perhaps you sat at home, with a pen and paper over many nights, scribbling ideas, honing them, refining them... or</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">perhaps it came to you while you were sitting at your desk in work...getting paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">And when am I going to do the work? Well, during my working day..when other customer&#x27;s should be paying me, so aren&#x27;t, because I am working on your idea, but that&#x27;s ok, because its gonna sell like....well..I&#x27;ve already explained that.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So..Imagine all goes well...and the sales do well...From day 1 we&#x27;re splitting the spoils, and this has really paid off. The customer who was going to pay me has gone to a competitor, but hey...I&#x27;m doing ok out of &quot;very cool idea 1.0&quot;. Version 2.0 will probably make even more anyway.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Or</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It hasn&#x27;t sold well...I&#x27;m behind on my mortgage...The customer who was going to pay me has gone to a competitor..and he&#x27;s not coming back.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">How are things with you?.....Oh...this was actually just a side project...so all is well; you&#x27;re still in your day job. Hey...nothing ventured, nothing gained right?</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Ehhh.....</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">A good idea is valuable. If there&#x27;s real evidence of work being done to develop or prove the idea, that mitigates the risk. If you&#x27;ve crunched the numbers, even better. (If its that good, you&#x27;d be crazy to be giving chunks of the revenue away).</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Tell you what. I&#x27;ve another model. Lets use some hypothethical figures. We&#x27;ve knocked around your idea. Its going to cost €10k to develop, and you&#x27;re interested in a revenue share. Now...lets consider the risk element.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Here&#x27;s a deal: I&#x27;m taking all the risk, and I see the value of your idea. So how about I do it for €5k, and there&#x27;s some compensation for the risk. There&#x27;s two things we can do. How about the first €10k it makes goes 100% to me, and after that we go 50/50 ? Or...How about we reflect the risk in the revenue share from day 1. So...Your investment is only €5k, but the revenue split is 70% to the developer, 30% to you.</p>
