<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Travel Apps specific to Dublin</strong></h2>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Travelling by bike</strong></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Our first category, travelling by bike, only turns up bike apps in Dublin. Sorry rest of Ireland! </p>
<h4 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Dublin Bikes App</strong></h4>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Just Eat dublinbikes is a self-service bike rental system open to everyone from 14 years of age. It enables you to travel through the city centre, commute between home and work and get out and about to enjoy Dublin city at your leisure.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">They currently have 102 stations for their bikes. See their full list of stations <a class="text-primary " href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Stations/View-stations/Just-Eat-dublinbikes-station-list">here</a>. Note: some of these stations are credit card enabled but not all! It’s more convenient to download the app.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">You can enjoy a 3 day pass or an annual subscription of €25 and then there’s a pricing structure to use the app. See their pricing structure <a class="text-primary " href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Subscription/Pricing-Structure/Pricing-structure">here</a>. </p>

<h4 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Bleeperbike App</strong></h4>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Beeeperbike is another bike hiring scheme, again operating in Dublin. Although they have a pilot scheme in Sligo. The difference with Bleeperbikes and Dublinbikes is that Bleeperbikes is stationless. Using their clever locking system, Bleeperbikes allows you to park at any recognised public parking stand in Dublin. You can use their app to identify these spaces. You must park the bike within the Green Zone, which you can find on their app. If you park the bike outside the green zone for collection you will incur an additional cost.</p>

If you are new to cycling or getting out on the bike after a long break, the Cycle Planner will find a route that avoids roads with heavy traffic and also avoids difficult turns at busy junctions to help you get comfortable cycling your bike around town.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">For the more advanced cyclists the cycle planner will tell you about the most direct route to take whilst still recommending cycle tracks where they exist. The cycle planner covers Dublin city centre and all the larger towns around County Dublin.</p>

You can also calculate your fare, get bus timetables and a route planner. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be an official Dublin Bus Android version of the app but I found an alternative that has received a lot of good reviews.

<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Travelling by Luas</strong></h3>
<h4 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Luas App</strong></h4>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Dublin’s tram network has its very own app. It provides real time forecasts of tram arrivals at each stop. The app also allows you to identify your nearest stop and get directions to it, calculate fares between two stops and check operating hours. It also provides live travel updates regarding its service.</p>

<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Travelling by bus, dart, rail or Luas</strong></h3>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The Real Time Ireland app integrates all real time arrival information services from Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Go-Ahead Ireland, Dart, Iarnród Éireann and Luas. </p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">You can see up to date information of when your bus/Luas/train will be at a stop or station. You can also view stops and routes on a map and navigate through the map for additional stops and information. The app allows you to set up favourites so that you can quickly access real time information for your regular stop. It creates reminders to notify you when a bus is approaching your stop, or when you are near a certain bus stop. You can set alerts when your bus is 10, 20 or 30 minutes away from a certain bus stop, so you can plan when to leave home or work.
