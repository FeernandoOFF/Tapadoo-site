I think so</h1><div class="w-full bg-neutral h-[1px] my-8 opacity-60"></div><p class="blog-text text-justify">WWDC is a special place for me. I first visited in 2009, and went to every one between 2011 and 2017.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It starts with the keynote, which is where Apple tells us what&#x27;s coming in iOS, MacOS and usually some new capabilities or tools is it making available for developers.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It used to also be where they&#x27;d announce new hardware; I was there for the announcement of the iPhone 3GS, Retina Mac Book, Better MacBook Airs, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">One thing I&#x27;ve got used to is the reaction of &quot;normals&quot; to WWDC. Each year I come back, and someone who doesn&#x27;t work in App Development, or doesn&#x27;t own a Mac usually says something like &quot;I heard Apple did X&quot;, where X is a derivative of an announcement. &quot;I heard apple cancelled an iPad&quot; may be a derivative of Apple revving the entire line up, dropping some prices, and quietly cancelling the lowest end model.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I get it, subtleties can&#x27;t really be portrayed in an article or news snippet; Sometimes I find myself trying to explain it, but I just come across as a pure fanboy.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">In recent years, the hardware announcements have taken a back seat in favour of announcing software updates, and new developer tools. I caught the collective gasp of surprise when Apple announced Swift in 2014 in a year we all said &quot;This was about the developers&quot;.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">And this week, developers are happy with the announcements - SwiftUI looks like the foundation for all future apps, and will ease bringing them to the Mac. Simpler ways to animate and a standardised set of symbols, much simplified encryption are just a taste of what&#x27;s to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The new Mac Pro, and the XDR display are indeed very, very impressive pieces of kit. But here&#x27;s the rub: They aren&#x27;t something that you or I need. They aren&#x27;t something that a developer needs. These are truly aimed at specific tasks that are very niche: Professional Photography, Video editing and audio composing/editing.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So, why launch a high-end workstation at a developer conference at all? Here&#x27;s what I think:</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>The crowd will love it</strong>. Because we&#x27;re developers and high end specs impress us. But, I&#x27;d be surprised if 1% of the audience will purchase one. Remember, A standard MacBook Pro is very capable of running XCode.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>There&#x27;s no other logical time to announce it</strong>. Is it too niche to have it&#x27;s own event? I&#x27;m not so sure about this, as each year the iPad announcements have tended to be about &quot;the creators&quot;. Perhaps the iPad announcement is a better time to talk about the new Pro equipment. Of course, maybe Apple like that the iPad event is <em>just</em> about the iPad.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So why is everyone talking about at $999 Monitor Stand ?</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">WWDC is a real marquee event for Apple. This means all of the news outlets show up. To give you an idea: The outside is surrounded by Satellite Dishes, there&#x27;s a massive section filled with news cameras, and the Irish Times and Irish Independent typically fly over a correspondent. Everything Apple say in the keynote will be reported on, analysed, and distilled to bite sized pieces.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">$999 for a monitor stand is ridiculous. Or at least, out of context it is ridiculous. It&#x27;s the perfect &quot;look how crazy Apple have got&quot; kind of tidbit, that will work great in a news article, or a 30 second news radio slot.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The subtleties that Apple have just undercut significantly the pro monitor market are always going to be lost. Most normals see Apple as a high-end consumer brand. They do not think of it as a brand which has always been the only computer you&#x27;d see in a professional studio, or a brand on every desk in Pixar. Nobody will realise they are competing with monitors in the $20,000-$50,000 price range.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Yesterday I spoke to some normals, they were asking me about the new MacBook Air I had with me. And one of them mentioned &quot;I heard Apple announced something weird, was it a new monitor ? or a stand or something?&quot;</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">And that&#x27;s when I realised: Announcing a $999 stand was a mis-step.</p></section></div> </main><footer class="p-10 bg-[#eeeeee90] text-[#A09893] "><div class="app-container footer"><div><img src="/Tapadoo-site/_next/static/media/tapadoo-large-logo.b51a8a63.png" alt="Tapadoo logo" class="w-full max-w-[120px] cursor-pointer grayscale"/><div class="my-4"><p>26-28 Strand Street Great, Dublin 1 </p><a href="mailto:enquiries@tapadoo.com">enquiries@tapadoo.com</a></div><a href="tel:3531123456">+353 1 123456</a></div><div><span class="footer-title">Links</span><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/tapadoo/contact">Privacy Policy</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/tapadoo/contact">Support</a></div><div><span class="footer-title">Company</span><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/tapadoo/about">About us</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/tapadoo/careers">Careers</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/apps/costs">Pricing</a><a class="link link-hover" href="/Tapadoo-site/blog/1">Blog</a></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Was announcing a $999 stand a mis-step?
