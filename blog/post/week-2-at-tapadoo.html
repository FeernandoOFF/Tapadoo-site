<p class="blog-text text-justify">I was chosen as the iOS developer on the first day. I had meddled with Android development in the past, but never gotten the chance to try out iOS as I don’t own a Mac or an iPhone at home. This was the perfect chance to start!</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">To begin iOS development, I first had to learn Objective C. In college we focused primarily on Java and PHP and I’ve done a bit of Python in my spare time, but Objective C is quite different from them in terms of syntax, and so took a bit of time to get used to.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I started off with a bug fix here and there for a project that is near completion, which was a really good way to get a feel for the standard I should be aiming for. It also allowed me to learn Objective C by reading the other developers’ code and trying to modify/add to it (without breaking it!). I spent the rest of my time buried in the Apple documentation!</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">Every day we have a standup in the office, where each of us summarize what we’ve accomplished or struggled with that day. I think this is a great way to get to know what other people are working on, and what is involved in each project.</p>
