As early as 2011, our founder <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dermdaly/">Dermot</a>, was skeptical about HTML5 for rendering user interface elements on mobile. He was right! You can read his original blog post <a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/2011/no-html5-is-not-the-answer/">here</a>.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We read recently how Airbnb and Udacity dropped React Native in favour of native app development. Both Airbnb and Udacity’s engineering departments released posts on why they reverted to native app development. I’d highly recommend a read of both; <a class="text-primary " href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c">React Native at Airbnb</a> &amp; <a class="text-primary " href="https://engineering.udacity.com/react-native-a-retrospective-from-the-mobile-engineering-team-at-udacity-89975d6a8102">React Native at Udacity</a>. This confirmed our belief in native app development even more.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>An opportunity to try new things</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">That said, we are always up for a challenge. So when the opportunity came along to develop a cross platform app using React Native, we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We had the pleasure of working with a large multinational car manufacturer on an app for their marketing campaign.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The app has had over 50,000 downloads since we delivered the product. We’ve learnt some things from the process that we’d like to share with you.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Cross platform development</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Native app development is where you write a specific codebase for Android or iOS. Whereas, cross platform development only involves writing a single codebase which can be deployed on both platforms.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Why choose cross platform?</strong></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Maintaining a single codebase lowers code duplication, and in theory, reduces iteration cycles.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Cross platform frameworks like React Native, Xamarin, Flutter and Ionic endeavour to accomplish this. Write once, test on both platforms, and deploy.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Sounds too good to be true, right?</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">In some cases it is.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><strong>Who uses cross platform frameworks?</strong></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><a class="text-primary " href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html">Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype and Tesla</a> all used React Native to produce their flagship apps. Facebook created ReactJS in 2011, a widely used web development framework. In 2013 React Native began at an internal hackaton. It built on ReactJS and was open sourced on Github in 2015.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Google&#x27;s Flutter is gaining ground in the cross platform world. It’s used by <a class="text-primary " href="https://flutter.io/showcase/">Alibaba, and their own AdWords app</a>. While it’s still in alpha, some promising work is surfacing. I recommend checking out the beautiful <a class="text-primary " href="http://reflect.ly/">Reflectly app.</a></p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Why is native app development better?</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The development world is far from ideal. Developing for any platform comes with a host of potential issues. Unknowns exist around every corner. </p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Once you deploy a non-native development tool, you position yourself even further away from the operating system. This may be a compromise some products can live with but it&#x27;s not a decision that should be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Apps are becoming more complex. They are leveraging the latest hardware and technologies to increase immersion. Every year operating systems are revised and updated. iOS 12 has recently been released and Android P will be available soon. There are a host of new features and APIs with these updates. Apps need to utilise the latest operating systems features in order to succeed.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Cross platform frameworks are in a perpetual game of cat and mouse to keep up.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><em>Performance</em></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Often cited as a major drawback of any cross platform framework. React Native suffers poor performance at times, such as frame dropping. Poor performance will compromise the user experience significantly.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Developers often blame the performance issues on the framework, when it is actually often improper use of the APIs.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">But with the lack of documentation and continuously changing APIs within React Native, it&#x27;s no wonder that it can lead to substandard app design.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><em>Third party dependency</em></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">You relinquish granular control to a third party when you utilise a cross development platform. This can lead to instability and penalise maintainability. </p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">One of our core principles at Tapadoo is delivering stable mobile applications. Maintaining a low to zero crash rate is what we strive for.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We include analytics and crash reporting within our apps. This allows us to maintain low crash rates and provides valuable data on app usage. To include these SDKs in React Native, we needed an additional dependency to allow invocation via the shared codebase.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We have been able to achieve a crash free rate of above 98% on our cross platform project. However, a significant number of crashes are occurring from within the React Native SDK. We&#x27;ve continuously had to update to the latest version of React Native to combat this. This hasn&#x27;t always improved the crash rate but it has increased maintenance effort.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><em>Platform specific styling</em></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Both Android and iOS maintain individual style guidelines. Android&#x27;s material design is largely based on the physical world, with views having elevations and cast shadows. The iOS human interface guidelines lean towards flat design. Both give each platform a distinct but familiar user experience.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Cross platform user interface components often feel unnatural. They do not conform to either standard as default.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Platform specific styles can and should be added where possible to ensure an experience in keeping with operating system norms.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl "><em>Developer support</em></h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Not all development environments are created equally, but some are above the curve. It is these types of environments that help developers do their job efficiently.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">A colossal amount of work has been undertaken to build tools to help developers wade through the trenches. Both iOS and Android have well established tools, designed with ease of use in mind. Tools developers use everyday but often take for granted. Tools like layout previews, debugger breakpoints, code injection and documentation lookup, which are in-built to Android Studio and Xcode.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There are often multiple tools for developing with a cross platform framework, but their standards leave much to be desired. For React Native, some promising IDEs do exist, such as <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.decoide.org/">Deco</a>, <a class="text-primary " href="https://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a> and <a class="text-primary " href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Where is cross platform useful?</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There are certainly use cases for cross platform development. Cross platform can potentially reduce development time for prototyping or producing a minimal viable product. Provided an experienced developer is undertaking the task.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Hybrid apps</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The React Native app we built utilised sensor and location data. This was a challenge for pure React Native. It meant we had to implement some native code on both Android and iOS to fulfil these requirements.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We now have a hybrid codebase. Cross platform, mixed with native code. Between 5% to 10% of the codebase is native. User interface code is shared, with minor exceptions to platform specific styling. The reuse of code was kept high. This is a massive benefit and the core motivation for choosing a cross platform framework.</p>
<h2 class="blog-subtitle "><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">After this experience, our view remains. It is more challenging to achieve a quality product using a cross platform framework.  Quality, maintainability, user experience, and the ability to innovate, all deteriorate. No matter how fast these frameworks mature, it&#x27;s hard to see them contend with native app development.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Should you go cross platform?</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Maybe.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">This is a decision that will likely stay with you for the lifecycle of your product. There are merits, which are especially attractive from a business perspective. But the core technology you&#x27;re building may suffer in the long term. </p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">As a company who are responsible for producing high quality apps, native is the right strategy. We pride ourselves on pushing the boundaries of app development, anything that limits this, is out of the equation.</p>
