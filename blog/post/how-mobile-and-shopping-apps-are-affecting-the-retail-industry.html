with consumers in a more personal and targeted way. Reaching consumers with discounts and special offers is more effective through an app that people have signed up to than printed material or billboards. Through a compelling user experience, users are more inclined to sign up to loyalty programs and be open to receive push notifications.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">A survey from <a class="text-primary " href="https://visualobjects.com/app-development/top-mobile-app-development-companies/when-where-people-use-shopping-apps">Visual Objects</a> found the reason for the success of larger-scale shopping apps was a streamlined user experience and brand recognition, inferring that smaller brands could garner similar success through building trust while also delivering an exceptional user experience.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">While driving discounts and lower prices is an important marketing strategy for many retailers, it&#x27;s not the only reason why millennials downloads apps. 54% download retail apps because it is often easier to download and use the app than it is to use the mobile site.</p>
