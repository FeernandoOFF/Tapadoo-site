We&#x27;re fans of the GAA at Tapadoo. We go to the early season games, and suffer through the cold conditions all for the love of the game.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There&#x27;s a common sight you see at every game: The diehard fan. Studying the match programme, ear piece in ear and pencil in hand. Ready to mark down every free, score and substitution.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">When a point occurs at the other end of the field we hear &quot;who scored that?&quot;, &quot;was it Brogan?&quot;, &quot;I think it was Mannion&quot;. The diehard knows. He heard on AM radio, but the rest of us will have to make do with watching it on Sky+ when we get home.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">As mobile app developers we got to thinking:</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>Surely there must be a better way.</strong></p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There&#x27;s been some attempts at digitising the programme into mobile apps. They tend to be little more than PDF readers where the thinking centred around the existing product: The paper programme. The static, can&#x27;t change, went to print 2 days ago paper programme.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>Surely we can do better.</strong></p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">How would we approach it? Well, we&#x27;ve put together some concepts.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Our vision is for the &quot;Live match programme&quot;. A match programme in your pocket, that lives with the game. It updates along with the game, giving you what happened, when it happened and by whom. A place where at a glance you can see who scored that last point, and what their tally is.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The main screen of the app shows the teams, score and current time. When you tap on a team name we see the team as currently lined out (kept up to date of course). Beside each player we see their score tally, and any cards they&#x27;ve received. In the example below, we&#x27;re also highlighting who scored last (in this case, Brogan)</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">When a major event occurs, a top banner will show not just happened, but who was responsible</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">So how would this information get into the app? We&#x27;ve thought of that too. We call this &quot;The commentators companion&quot;. This allows a sideline staff member to report on the game as it happens, feeding the data to the Live Programme app.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">With just 2 or three taps, sideline staff member can report on every event as it happens. Here we show how to report a substitution he taps &quot;substitution&quot;, the player being substituted, and the player coming on, and hits &quot;Publish&quot;.</p>
