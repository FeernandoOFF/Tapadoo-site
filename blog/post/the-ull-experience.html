<p class="blog-text text-justify"> As you can see from above, the food was glorious , and everyone was well catered for.</p>

It detailed how ideas are nothing without implementation, and much of what John mentioned really stuck in my mind. His talk really wrapped up the conference as a whole in my opinion, and was a fitting conclusion to what had previously been presented.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">On the final night, everyone relaxed and socialised. I had the pleasure of hearing <a class="text-primary " href="https://twitter.com/liamdunne">Liam Dunne</a> play a couple of songs to a select few, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. He finished up on Hey Joe by Jimi Hendrix, to much applause!</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I left the conference with a renewed sense of openness to ideas and the creative process. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get to go back some year soon, and catch up with all the great people I had the opportunity of speaking with.</p>
