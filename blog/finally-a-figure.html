A Figure</p><p>
One of the big questions I come across when dealing with clients is the question of iPhone penetration in Ireland. Clients want to know the type of reach their app idea may get, and this is a valid question. We&#x27;ve tried getting this a number of times, but it is a commercially sensitive figure; We&#x27;ve good relations with O2, as they engage with Irish iPhone developers, but its the one thing they won&#x27;t budge on. Actually, the question is a source of amusement at this stage; We joke about getting the figure; we know they don&#x27;t necessarily want to give it out. In that regard, it reminds me of asking questions of Apple employees couched in the future tense. Its fun, but don&#x27;t expect an answer. But the today, there&#x27;s another organisation who have access to empirical data from their ad network. So today, I give you the figure that we now believe to be the figure. Bear in mind, its a point in time figure

&gt; **There are 250,000 iPhones in Ireland**

At least, that&#x27;s according to the [article on silicon republic](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/15660/comms/there-are-now-250-000-iphones-in-ireland).

That&#x27;s only a starter statistic though. Take a look at actual app sales figures. Who are selling apps? Well, you could look at [this article](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-responsible-for-994-of-mobile-app-sales-in-2009.ars) which gives Gartner&#x27;s take on it.

Or...I&#x27;ll save you the bother and give you the management overview from the bottom of the article: ![Wow.](images/app_store_pie_chart_640.png) Wow.
