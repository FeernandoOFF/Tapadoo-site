Try this</p><p>
We&#x27;ve had this ongoing issue on our Continuous Integration server which had us scratching our heads. It went like this:

1. We create a certificate for our CI &quot;Developer&quot;
2. We add him to the provisioning certificate
3. The build is fine
4. Some time later, we update the provisioning profile, and install this - We remove the old certificate from the key chain
5. Each subsequent build, the old certificate magically re-appears in the key chain, and the code-signing fails as there are multiple matched certificates in the keychain

If you&#x27;ve seen this; here&#x27;s what I think is happening, and here&#x27;s how you work around it.

The certificate is embedded in the provisioning certificate. During the code signing process, a check is made to see if this is in the keychain; if it isn&#x27;t, the code signing process adds it to the keychain. Because the keychain has a matching private key, the certificate is now valid again, but cannot be used, as you now have 2 keys with the same identity in the keychain.

We tried deleting the older certificate time and time again, but the build process always brought it back. So frustrating. Also; there&#x27;s radars about this ([example](http://openradar.appspot.com/9173280), and there&#x27;s [questions on StackOverflow about it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5932522/codesign-error-certificate-identity-appearing-twice).

But here&#x27;s a little tip that helps; Note the certificate is put back into the keychain, but codesign will only work with a certificate where the private key is also in the keychain. The problem arises when the re-inserted certificate has its private key in the keychain.

So, next time this happens

1. Locate the older, duplicate certificate
2. Expand it
3. Delete it&#x27;s private key

Now, even if you remove the certificate also, and even if your build re-instates the certificate, the private key will not be in the keychain, and so this older, duplicate certificate will not be used to sign your binary.

Yay. Go us.
