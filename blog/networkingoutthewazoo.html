We&#x27;ve got biz camps and bar camps, open coffees, networking (with or without speed), developer garages, meetups, tweetups, seminars, congresses and a whole host of other such events. One could easily spend their entire week going to events to network and get one&#x27;s business &quot;out there&quot;.

But in these difficult times, attendance at these events skyrockets. Everyone is there to raise awareness of their company, looking for business, staring a new business, etc. Here&#x27;s the question

&gt; Is there much _actual_ business going on?

Almost everyone is a seller, very few are buyers. In fact, buyers don&#x27;t need to attend network events to find suppliers. Most people&#x27;s compelling reason to go along is to speak rather than to listen.

Ok. I&#x27;ll caveat some of this

- _I know_ that networking events are to make contacts, that may be fruitful in the long term, not necessarily right now.
- _I know_ that effective networking is about listening first
- _I know_ that going along to networking events is important and beneficial

But.

You can kid yourself that attending these events is very high priority, important work; essential to your business. Sure its important, but its not the _most_ important.

I often refer to this kind of non-essential work as &quot;_non work_&quot;. The kind of work that you can claim (to yourself) that you&#x27;re working, when in fact, you&#x27;re actually doing something **more enjoyable** than the stuff **you should be doing**. (Writing a blog entry when I should be coding anyone?). We all do it, but sometimes there&#x27;s a need to focus.

I&#x27;m not suggesting that one shouldn&#x27;t go to events such as these, I just think you need to choose wisely. Go along to a few, and you&#x27;ll find the same names and faces. Its great to speak in person to those people you&#x27;ve only ever conversed with on twitter, but there isn&#x27;t a benefit in having the same conversation with the same person in 2 days time.

So...review you calendar, then take a look at the deadlines you&#x27;ve set to getting the _actual_ work done. What&#x27;s a better use of your time? Going to that event, or finishing the product features roadmap?
