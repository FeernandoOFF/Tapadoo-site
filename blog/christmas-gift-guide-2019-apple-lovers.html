If you&#x27;re an Apple fan like us then you&#x27;ll love the new Apple product releases for 2019. We&#x27;ve put together the perfect Christmas Gift Guide.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">You&#x27;d probably prefer to receive one of these as a gift rather than give one! But, as Christmas is a time of giving, the products listed here would make an ideal Christmas gift for a loved one. Maybe you can leave subtle hints for the one you want, like forwarding this blog post on!</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So here goes this year&#x27;s latest products from Apple.</p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl ">iPhone 11</h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Apple announced the release of the iPhone 11 at their event in September of this year. You can get the phone in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB. It runs on the A13 Bionic chip processor with third-generation neural engine.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The camera comes with a 12 megapixel lens, next generation Smart HDR and Portrait Lighting. It has a dual camera, unlike the <a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/">iPhone XR</a> with a single camera, making the iPhone 11 a more superior camera.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It has an ultra wide lens and 2x optical zoom out and digital zoom up to 5x. And a pixel density of 326ppi.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The screen size is the same as the iPhone XR at 6.1 inch.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It&#x27;s estimated that you get up to 17 hours of battery life with the new iPhone 11. Roughly an hour and a half longer than the XR.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The main differences between the iPhone 11 and XR are the processor and camera capabilities. Also the colours are more pastel than the bright colours of the XR. You&#x27;ll still get a great experience with the XR so don&#x27;t rush to buy unless you specifically want a better camera and processing speed.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">For further details check out Apple&#x27;s <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/ie/iphone-11/specs/">iPhone 11 spec</a>.

<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl ">iPhone 11 Pro</h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The iPhone 11 Pro sees the introduction of the triple camera. Like the iPhone 11 it too uses the A13 Bionic processing chip, which is the fastest phone chip available. The OLED display is also a lot brighter than the iPhone 11.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It has a tripe 12 megapixel lens with two lenses being the same as the iPhone 11 and a telephoto lens with an aperture of f/20. Thanks to the third lens the iPhone 11 Pro has 2x optical zoom in. It has also has 2x optical zoom out and a 10x digital zoom. The pixel density is 458ppi.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The screen size is the same as the <a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/">iPhone XS</a> at 5.8 inches. Unlike the iPhone 11 the Pro has OLED displays giving brighter and sharper colours.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The pro is smaller and lighter than the 11 with a new frosted glass finish.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Battery life is similar to the iPhone 11 with maybe an extra hour added.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">It has a Super Retina XDR display, whereas the iPhone XS has a Super Retina HD Display. They are similar in size but the the iPhone 11 Pro has a higher brightness compared to the iPhone XS.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Should you upgrade from the XS to the iPhone 11 Pro? If you want a camera, processor and material upgrade, along with display and battery improvements, and a move from 3D Touch to Haptic Touch, then maybe an upgrade is for you.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">With the added benefits comes a difference in size. The iPhone Pro Max is 77.8 x 158 x 8.1mm. Compare this to the iPhone Pro at 71.4 x 144 x 8.1mm.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There&#x27;s no difference between the performance or camera. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have the same specs for these.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The biggest difference between the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the triple rear camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max along with better battery life.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify"><a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro/6.5-inch-display-512gb-gold-unlocked">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a></p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl ">iPad 10.2 inch</h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Along with the release of the iPhone 11 Apple also released a new iPad, the 10.2 inch. The iPad 10.2 inch replaces the 9.7 inch, which has now been discontinued. Although you may still be able to pick it up.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The iPad 10.2 inch is 10mm longer and 5mm wider than the iPad 9.7 inch.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There aren&#x27;t many other differences between both versions. They both have a pixel density of 264ppi and the iPad 10.2 inch has a resolution of 2,160 x 1,620, whereas the 9.7 inch has a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Both have the same internal processor (A10 Fusion) and 10 hour battery life. The camera is also the same on both at 8 megapixels.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The only real difference with the iPad 10.2 inch is the screen size is bigger and it is now compatible with the <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/ie/smart-keyboard/">Apple Smart Keyboard</a>. It also supports <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/ie/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify"><a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2">iPad 10.2&quot;</a></p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl ">iPad Air 10.5 inch</h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If you are looking for speed and space then maybe the iPad Air is a better choice over the iPad 10.2 inch. Both iPads are the same size at 9.8 inch by 6.8 inch. The Air is slightly thinner. They also have the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The Air supports Apple&#x27;s TrueTone tech, which adjusts the colours on the screen to better reflect the light around you.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The 10.2 inch iPad comes in 32GB and 128GB, whereas the iPad Air starts at 64GB and goes up to 256GB.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If you want the Smart Keyboard with your iPad then the iPad Air is a better fit. Although the 10.2 inch fits with the Smart Keyboard the iPad Air is a better fit. It also has a better FaceTime camera. The iPad 10.2 inch has a 1.2 megapixel camera that records video in 720p. The iPad Air, however, has a 7 megapixel camera that records at 1080p.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify"><img src="/Tapadoo-site/images/iPadAir2019-1024x1024.jpeg" class="my-3"/></p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><a class="text-primary " href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air">iPad Air</a></p>
<h3 class="blog-subtitle text-2xl ">iPad mini 5</h3>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The iPad mini 5 launches with Apple&#x27;s iOS 13 update and will also see <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-buy-the-ipad-mini-5-5-reasons-not-to/">four years software support</a>.

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The differences start with the camera. Both iPads have a rear camera of 8MP and 1080p video. While the iPad mini 4 has a 1.2MP front camera with 720 video, the iPad 4 mini now has a 7MP front camera with 1080p video.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The iPad mini 5 has the A12 Bionic chip processor, which is a big jump from the iPad mini 4 A8 chip. This should see a significant difference in speed.</p>

It comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm and has the same Haptic technology as the iPhone.</p>

You can turn the always-on feature off and hide elements you don&#x27;t want appearing on the screen.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">Apple introduced its second generation AirPods this year. It&#x27;s more of an upgrade to the original <a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/">AirPods</a>. They now have a H1 chip and wireless charging.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The H1 chip should improve connectivity and battery life. There&#x27;s also a new Siri voice activation feature. The wireless charging allows you to use a Qi-compatible charging mat to charge the case.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If you want to have the wireless option you&#x27;ll need to purchase the charging case separately and pay extra for the wireless charging feature. The charging case gives up to 20 hours battery life. This is on top of the 5 hours for the buds.</p>

<p class="blog-text text-justify">The new AirPods Pro have been released with some big improvements on the <a class="text-primary " href="https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/">basic AirPods</a>. Probably their biggest distinction is their new noise-cancelling feature. This is the first time Apple has introduced this feature and are looking to compete against the normally chunkier earphone market.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">There&#x27;s been an improvement with design also with three silicone tip sizes included. You can also do a fit test on your iPhone to make sure you have a good seal. The test will tell you to adjust the fit or try a different silicone tip.</p>

If you're an Apple fan like us then you'll love the new Apple product releases for 2019. We've put together the perfect Christmas Gift Guide.\n\nYou'd probably prefer to receive one of these as a gift rather than give one! But, as Christmas is a time of giving, the products listed here would make an ideal Christmas gift for a loved one. Maybe you can leave subtle hints for the one you want, like forwarding this blog post on!\n\nSo here goes this year's latest products from Apple.\n\n### iPhone 11\n\nApple announced the release of the iPhone 11 at their event in September of this year. You can get the phone in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB. It runs on the A13 Bionic chip processor with third-generation neural engine.\n\nThe camera comes with a 12 megapixel lens, next generation Smart HDR and Portrait Lighting. It has a dual camera, unlike the [iPhone XR](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/) with a single camera, making the iPhone 11 a more superior camera.\n\nIt has an ultra wide lens and 2x optical zoom out and digital zoom up to 5x. And a pixel density of 326ppi.\n\nThe screen size is the same as the iPhone XR at 6.1 inch.\n\nIt's estimated that you get up to 17 hours of battery life with the new iPhone 11. Roughly an hour and a half longer than the XR.\n\nThe main differences between the iPhone 11 and XR are the processor and camera capabilities. Also the colours are more pastel than the bright colours of the XR. You'll still get a great experience with the XR so don't rush to buy unless you specifically want a better camera and processing speed.\n\nFor further details check out Apple's [iPhone 11 spec](https://www.apple.com/ie/iphone-11/specs/). You can buy the iPhone 11 from [€609 with a trade in](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11), otherwise it starts at [€829](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPhone 11](images/iphone11-2019-854x1024.jpeg)\n\n[iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/ie/iphone-11/specs/)\n\n### iPhone 11 Pro\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro sees the introduction of the triple camera. Like the iPhone 11 it too uses the A13 Bionic processing chip, which is the fastest phone chip available. The OLED display is also a lot brighter than the iPhone 11.\n\nIt has a tripe 12 megapixel lens with two lenses being the same as the iPhone 11 and a telephoto lens with an aperture of f/20. Thanks to the third lens the iPhone 11 Pro has 2x optical zoom in. It has also has 2x optical zoom out and a 10x digital zoom. The pixel density is 458ppi.\n\nThe screen size is the same as the [iPhone XS](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/) at 5.8 inches. Unlike the iPhone 11 the Pro has OLED displays giving brighter and sharper colours.\n\nThe pro is smaller and lighter than the 11 with a new frosted glass finish.\n\nBattery life is similar to the iPhone 11 with maybe an extra hour added.\n\nIt has a Super Retina XDR display, whereas the iPhone XS has a Super Retina HD Display. They are similar in size but the the iPhone 11 Pro has a higher brightness compared to the iPhone XS.\n\nShould you upgrade from the XS to the iPhone 11 Pro? If you want a camera, processor and material upgrade, along with display and battery improvements, and a move from 3D Touch to Haptic Touch, then maybe an upgrade is for you.\n\nYou can read more detailed specs for the iPhone 11 Pro [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/iphone-11-pro/specs/). The price starts at [€859 with a trade in](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro) or [€1,179 without](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPhone 11 Pro.](images/iphone-11-pro2019-854x1024.jpeg)\n\n[iPhone 11 Pro](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro)\n\n### iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max has all the features of the iPhone 11 Pro with some added benefits, mainly display and battery.\n\nThe display size for the iPhone Pro Max is 6.5 inch Super Retina XDR, 2688 x 1242 compared to the Pro with 5.8 include Super Retina XDR, 2436 x 1125.\n\nIt has a five hour longer battery life than the XS Max.\n\nWith the added benefits comes a difference in size. The iPhone Pro Max is 77.8 x 158 x 8.1mm. Compare this to the iPhone Pro at 71.4 x 144 x 8.1mm.\n\nThere's no difference between the performance or camera. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have the same specs for these.\n\nThe biggest difference between the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the triple rear camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max along with better battery life.\n\nYou can read the full iPhone 11 Pro Max spec [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/iphone-11-pro/specs/) and compare it to the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nPrices start from [€859 with a trade in](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro) and from [€1,279 without](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPhone 11 Pro Max](images/iphone-11-pro-max2019.png)\n\n[iPhone 11 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro/6.5-inch-display-512gb-gold-unlocked)\n\n### iPad 10.2 inch\n\nAlong with the release of the iPhone 11 Apple also released a new iPad, the 10.2 inch. The iPad 10.2 inch replaces the 9.7 inch, which has now been discontinued. Although you may still be able to pick it up.\n\nThe iPad 10.2 inch is 10mm longer and 5mm wider than the iPad 9.7 inch.\n\nThere aren't many other differences between both versions. They both have a pixel density of 264ppi and the iPad 10.2 inch has a resolution of 2,160 x 1,620, whereas the 9.7 inch has a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536.\n\nBoth have the same internal processor (A10 Fusion) and 10 hour battery life. The camera is also the same on both at 8 megapixels.\n\nThe only real difference with the iPad 10.2 inch is the screen size is bigger and it is now compatible with the [Apple Smart Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/ie/smart-keyboard/). It also supports [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/ie/apple-pencil/).\n\nYou can read the full spec [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-10.2/specs/) and prices start from [€399 for 32GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2) [€499 for 128GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPad 10.2\".](images/10.222-iPad-2019-629x1024.jpeg)\n\n[iPad 10.2\"](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2)\n\n### iPad Air 10.5 inch\n\nIf you are looking for speed and space then maybe the iPad Air is a better choice over the iPad 10.2 inch. Both iPads are the same size at 9.8 inch by 6.8 inch. The Air is slightly thinner. They also have the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch.\n\nThe Air supports Apple's TrueTone tech, which adjusts the colours on the screen to better reflect the light around you.\n\nThe big advantage over the 10.2 inch is the speed. The iPad Air has an A12 Bionic chip compared to the A10 Fusion chip of the 10.2 inch version.\n\nThe 10.2 inch iPad comes in 32GB and 128GB, whereas the iPad Air starts at 64GB and goes up to 256GB.\n\nIf you want the Smart Keyboard with your iPad then the iPad Air is a better fit. Although the 10.2 inch fits with the Smart Keyboard the iPad Air is a better fit. It also has a better FaceTime camera. The iPad 10.2 inch has a 1.2 megapixel camera that records video in 720p. The iPad Air, however, has a 7 megapixel camera that records at 1080p.\n\nYou can read the tech spec [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-air/specs/) and the price starts from [€579 for 64GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air) and [€749 for 256GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPad Air 10.5\"](images/iPadAir2019-1024x1024.jpeg)\n\n[iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air)\n\n### iPad mini 5\n\nThe iPad mini 5 launches with Apple's iOS 13 update and will also see [four years software support](https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-buy-the-ipad-mini-5-5-reasons-not-to/). The design and measurements are the same but there has been changes to the spec.\n\nThe iPad mini 5 has a 7.9 inch display and 2048 x 1536 resolution. It has a pixel density of 326ppi. It has Touch ID and comes in silver, space grey and gold. Battery life is 10 hours. This is the same for the [iPad mini 4](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/).\n\nThe differences start with the camera. Both iPads have a rear camera of 8MP and 1080p video. While the iPad mini 4 has a 1.2MP front camera with 720 video, the iPad 4 mini now has a 7MP front camera with 1080p video.\n\nThe iPad mini 4 had 16GB, 32BG, 64GB and 128GB storage capacity, whereas the iPad mini 5 comes with 64GB and 256GB storage.\n\nThe iPad mini 5 has the A12 Bionic chip processor, which is a big jump from the iPad mini 4 A8 chip. This should see a significant difference in speed.\n\nYou can read the full spec [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-mini/specs/) and the price starts from [€469 for 64GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini) and [€639 for 256GB](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini).\n\n![Christmas Gift Guide 2019 for Apple Lovers. Image of iPad mini 5](images/iPad-mini-5-2019-1024x1024.jpeg)\n\n[iPad mini 5](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini)\n\n### Apple Watch Series 5\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 launched in September with two key features; the always-on display and S5 chip. It's pretty much the same as the Series 4 with a 326 dpi display at resolutions of 324 x 394 or 368 x 448 pixels. It comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm and has the same Haptic technology as the iPhone.\n\nThe always-on display is a key feature change this year. Unlike the [Apple Watch Series 4](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/apple-christmas-gift-guide-2018/) where the screen came on with a wrist raise, the new display is always on. You can turn the always-on feature off and hide elements you don't want appearing on the screen.\n\nThe display is the same as the Apple Watch Series 4 as in it uses a low-temperature polycrystalline OLED display.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 has been upgraded to 32GB of storage.

With upgraded features and a price drop what's not to like?\n\nThe MacBook Air 2019 has the same slim aluminium design as the 2018 model.

Probably their biggest distinction is their new noise-cancelling feature. This is the first time Apple has introduced this feature and are looking to compete against the normally chunkier earphone market.\n\nThere's been an improvement with design also with three silicone tip sizes included. You can also do a fit test on your iPhone to make sure you have a good seal. The test will tell you to adjust the fit or try a different silicone tip.\n\nThe AirPods Pro come with their own wireless case as standard. You get 24 hours battery life in the carrying case and 4.5 hours of continuous music when noise-cancellation is enabled. They have five hours battery life without noise-cancellation enabled.\n\nYou can use Siri to announce any text messages that come and dictate a reply if you want. This feature can work for all text messages that come in or only for favourites or the most recent.\n\nIf you don't like the noise-cancellation feature you can always switch back to Transparency Mode.\n\nYou can read the full spec [here](https://www.apple.com/ie/airpods-pro/specs/) and prices start from [€279](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/product/MWP22ZM/A/airpods-pro).\n\n![Image of AirPods Pro.](images/AirPods-Pro-1024x1024.jpeg)\n\n[AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/ie/airpods-pro/)\n\n### Apple Arcade\n\nApple Arcade is a video game subscription service from Apple that can run on iOS, iPad, Mac and Apple TV.
