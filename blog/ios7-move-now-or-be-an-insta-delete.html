Move now, or be an insta-delete.</p><p>
We all know that iOS 7 is imminent. We&#x27;re into Beta 3, so we can make semi-accurate guesses on when the full version will get released. So to all of our clients, I&#x27;d say you may want to think about having your app updated to iOS 7 VERY SOON.

**Why?**

Who remembers when the iPhone 5 came out? We briefed our clients. We said

&gt; &quot;We should probably do some work on your app and make it utilise the 4-inch screen&quot;.

Understandably, many of our clients wondered what benefit they&#x27;d derive. We were going to charge for the modifications; on first glance it could seem that we were just looking to get more fees out of them. We weren&#x27;t; we were actually giving them the correct advice.

The conversation kinda went like this:

&gt; &quot;So what happens if we don&#x27;t modify it, will it run on an iPhone ?5&quot; &quot;Oh yeah, it will run. Apple have this special &#x27;letterbox&#x27; mode&quot; (where we proceed to explain the letterboxing) &quot;Oh, that sounds fine let&#x27;s leave it so&quot; &quot;Are you sure? because...&quot; (where we explain letterboxing is kinda horrible) &quot;No, let&#x27;s just leave it&quot;

So we did.

**What happened when the iPhone 5 hit our shores?**

Well, within days of having it, a letterboxed app was pretty much an insta-delete.

At that point, our clients came back with urgent requests to make their app 4-inch compatible.

I predict the iOS 7 effect will be worse. Within a week of running full time, those apps which haven&#x27;t been modernised to look like an iOS 7 app will look _very_ old. They too will become insta-deletes.

If you have an app in the store, We&#x27;d highly recommend looking at modernising them pretty quick.

**Update:** [Stewart Curry](https://twitter.com/irishstu &quot;Stewart Curry&quot;) suggested I also make reference to adoption rates. What we know is Apple users upgrade _very quickly_. When iOS 5 launched, it caused a [massive worldwide spike in internet traffic](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/13/ios-5-update-internet-traffic-spike). iOS 6 was launched just 9 months ago (at time of writing), and is currently on 94% of all iOS devices [according to Apple&#x27;s figures](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/checklist/) (Unfortunately, this link is dynamic so will change over time. Trust me. When I wrote this, 94% was the figure). So, don&#x27;t kid yourself it will only affect &quot;power users&quot;. Not being iOS 7 ready will affect &quot;all users&quot;
