It has come to our attention that current versions of &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Phone Book&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Phone Book Pro&quot; are currently not operable. We regret to inform users that in light of a recent threat of legal challenge, we WILL NOT be providing a fix to the application in its current guise. We have also taken the decision to remove &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Phone Book&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Phone Book Pro&quot; from the App store.

We are engaging with a number of potential partners with a view to a long term solution and hope to be able to announce something shortly.

Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
