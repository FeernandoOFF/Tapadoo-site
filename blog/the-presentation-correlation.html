I&#x27;ve gone to a lot of presentations over the last couple of years. About two years ago I started to notice something, and I&#x27;ve been keeping tabs on it ever since. This will cause debate but here it does

&gt; People who use Apple&#x27;s Keynote to give presentations give better presentations.

There. I said it.

There&#x27;s more to this. I&#x27;m not suggesting that Powerpoint is a lesser tool than Keynote. I&#x27;ve my thoughts on this, but this is not the point I&#x27;m trying to make.

If someone arrives to a presentation, and he&#x27;s carrying a laptop, he&#x27;s going to use powerpoint. This presentation _may_ be good. It may be bad. If someone arrives to a presentation, and he&#x27;s carrying a MacBook, he&#x27;s most likely going to use Keynote. The presentation is _overwhelmingly more likely_ to be good.

Of course, I&#x27;ve seen great presentations given using Powerpoint, and rubbish ones given using Keynote, but these are both their own exceptions.

Why is this? To me its a question of taste.

- If someone has gone to the bother of switching to Mac, they&#x27;ve done this consciously. And usually, they&#x27;ve done it because they prefer the experience. If they&#x27;ve learned Keynote, they&#x27;ve gone to more effort again. (Look: we&#x27;re all switchers in Ireland. Macs really were niche for many, many years).
- So, my assertion goes like this. If you&#x27;re using Keynote on a Mac, you&#x27;ve got taste. If you&#x27;ve got taste, you&#x27;ll put more effort into your presentation.

I know there&#x27;s arguments that the software should just support the talk, blah-de-blah; I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;.

And so, I&#x27;ve watched this over the last two years or so, to see if my theory holds true.

**It does.**
