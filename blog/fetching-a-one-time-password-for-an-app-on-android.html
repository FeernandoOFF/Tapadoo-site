Are you looking to implement a one-time password (OTP) functionality in an Android app?

Android Developers have shared a handy new way to do this.

By using the SMS User Consent API you can prompt your users to share a single SMS message containing a one-time password. This means your app can now do SMS verification without asking for permission to read every single SMS message.

The API shows the user a prompt asking them if they want to share a single SMS message with your app. If the user accepts, the message will be shared with your app.

The new SMS User Consent API is making it a lot simpler. By using the API it prompts the user for permission to read that one text with the one-time password code. Once the user gives consent the app will have access to the entire message body to automatically [complete SMS verification](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/user-consent/overview).

A previous way of doing this was to have a backend implementation in-between to authenticate the message and get the code, but this new way gives you temporary access to the user&#x27;s messages. It then forwards that message to the app and lets you parse it manually.

You can also use the SMS retriever API for the same user flow. It creates a better user experience as the user won&#x27;t be prompted. You just have to modify the SMS message to allow it to be automatically forwarded to your Android app.

Check out the video below from [Android Developers](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/automatic-sms-verification-with-sms-user-consent-da8c16135e25) on how to start using the API.
