Dublin is awash with startups. It&#x27;s a great vibe, and there&#x27;s a real air of anticipation and positivity around Dublin right now.

But let&#x27;s face it. Whilst there are many great teams, great ideas may be thinner on the ground. I&#x27;ve no doubt that right now, there&#x27;s a talented team who are scratching their heads wondering if their idea was a good one in the first place. They&#x27;ve worked for months on it, and produced a pretty good MVP, but it just isn&#x27;t getting traction, and the VCs aren&#x27;t showing excitement either.

It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in the idea that your startup will change the world. It&#x27;s harder to look at it through the eyes of a person who hasn&#x27;t put the months in and realise that it&#x27;s not going to get off the ground.

Those last few weeks are hard. They&#x27;re the ones where you go from enthusiastic to unsure ... to ... &quot;what was I thinking?&quot; At some point, you have to face it and start looking for a new role.

What if I told you we need all that great stuff you&#x27;ve learnt while working on your startup? What if you had all the freedom to build something, but from scratch, with no worries about if there&#x27;s a salary next month?

Because that&#x27;s what Tapadoo needs right now. We&#x27;re looking to build our server side team, and we&#x27;re starting by looking for a [Server Side Developer](https://tapadoo.workable.com/j/A42239E20E), and a [Front-end developer](https://tapadoo.workable.com/j/1F9A0BD996). Heck, if you come together, we&#x27;d want you more.

We&#x27;ve an immediate project, immediate need, and not a line of code written yet.

If any of this resonates, please get in touch. It might be just the role for you. Our current offerings are listed on [here](https://tapadoo.workable.com).
