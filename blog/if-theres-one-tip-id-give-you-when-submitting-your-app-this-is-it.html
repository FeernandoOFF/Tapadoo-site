<blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>When uploading to itunesconnect, set your release date far in the future. When it comes ready for sale, set it back to when you really want to release it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Here&#x27;s why....</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">So, I finally go through the contracts processed and released my application. You can read all about it <a class="text-primary " href="/iephonebook">here</a>.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I made a simple mistake when I submitted it, and luckily this did not affect downloads, however I still feel this is an important point to make. <strong>Pay attention, new iPhone developers because I saw this tip on numerous sites and chose to ignore it</strong>.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">What I am talking about is setting your sale date. When uploading to itunestconnect, you are asked for my sale date. I mistakenly took this as something the reviewers would used to help decide how quickly they should review. No chance.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I suspect that the review team work more or less from a first in, first out basis (ok, there could be some exceptions, but basically). The sale date is for you only.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">I set mine to be a week away in the silly hope that they would review it quicker.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Here&#x27;s what actually happened:</p>
<ol>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">I submitted it for review 19 March, with a on sale date of 26 March</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">I received my first submission feedback 14 days later, on April 2, where they had found a crash</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">I fixed and resubmitted that evening</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">7 days later, on April 10, I received notice that the app was &quot;ready for sale&quot;</li>
<li class="list-disc ml-5 my-1">However, my contracts were pending (that&#x27;s another story) so when they got fixed on May 13, I set the App to go on sale the next day, May 14</li>
</ol>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Ok. Still with me? So, when my app is on sale, I look for it in iTunes by ordering by release date. No sign of it. I search backwards. Can&#x27;t find it.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Eventually, when I can find my app, its got a release date of April 10, i.e. the date it was <em>approved</em> (as my original &quot;on sale&quot; date was earlier).</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">This means my app missed its &quot;day in the sun&quot;. Being top of the list by release date is one way your app can get noticed after it is released. So don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">To reiterate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify"><strong>When uploading to itunesconnect, set your release date far in the future. When it comes ready for sale, set it back to when you really want to release it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The post script to this is my app has exceeded my expectations in terms of popularity, despite not being noticed as a &quot;newly released&quot; app. I&#x27;ll blog further thought on what to expect post release in a day or two.</p>
