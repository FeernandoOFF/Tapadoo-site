<p class="blog-text text-justify">Zartis is a social recruiting tool to help growing companies attract and hire great people; Think of us as a talent magnet.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We’re constantly trying to find creative ways to help high tech companies grow their teams. So paid ads on LinkedIn and Facebook often comes up in conversation.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The attitudes run something like this:</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">“You’re in LinkedIn and probably thinking about your career so it’s a good time and place to get someone’s attention.”</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">“I’ve never clicked on one of those ads.”</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">“The jobs displayed in LinkedIn definitely get your attention.”</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">As the saying goes: “I know half of my advertising budget is wasted, but I’m not sure which half”. Pay per click helps answer that, so we ran a simple test.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We created a Facebook ad for a freelance writer. After segmenting the audience by geography and demographics there were about 20,000 people in the target audience.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Because I’m writing this you can probably guess that we didn’t find our writer.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We created two variants of the same ad as a simple A/B test. The ad was seen by about 4,000 people, on average 5 times in one week. Four people in total clicked through. None applied for the job. Maybe I write lousy ad copy. It was pretty disappointing. We know Facebook can work extremely well for job referrals. See here for a quirky case study.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Total cost of experiment $1.60. Teacher’s comment: “Needs more practice.”</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Now, one our customers, Tapadoo, is looking for a mobile app developer. That’s one of the hardest roles to fill pretty much anywhere in the world right now. We tried to help by creating a LinkedIn display ad campaign.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">The job had already been tweeted by some high-Klout individuals. There were about 300 page views generated from the twitter traffic. But no applicants yet.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">We set the ad to a target of 26,853 people, based on the very granular segmentation offered by LinkedIn. Two variants were created for A/B testing. In one day there were 17,189 impressions and 4 click throughs resulting in one applicant.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">Total cost of experiment $11.03.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">What does this tell us? Not a huge amount sadly because our R&amp;D budget is so low. The laws of small numbers are dangerous.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If we stretched the numbers and spent $1103 buying 400 LinkedIn click throughs would we have got 100 applicants? That could potentially be very powerful.</p>
<p class="blog-text text-justify">If you’re reading this with £10k burning a hole in your pocket let me know and we can find which half is not wasted.</p>
