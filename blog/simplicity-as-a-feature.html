We recently launched a real-time bus app for Dublin called &quot;My Dublin Bus&quot; ([Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/mydublinbus &quot;Facebook Page&quot;), [iTunes Link](http://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/my-dublin-bus/id499001954?mt=8 &quot;iTunes Link&quot;)), and so far the majority of the reviews have been 5 Star. We&#x27;re happy about that.

The app is super-simple to use; In fact, simplicity is a feature. We put a lot of thought into this, and wanted to share the process behind this.

There are a number of bus apps out there; Some, like the official one is probably mandated to support many different kinds of commuter - the casual commuter, the everyday commuter, and the visitor. Others focus on the various bus routes, and take a map-centric approach to commuting; All of these are important useful features.

But, as an everyday commuter, I find myself needing 10% of those apps, with the other 90% &quot;in the way&quot;. I wanted something &quot;for me&quot;.

So, we challenged ourselves - how do we make it simple to use for the everyday user. I was the straw man. I use the bus every day. If I didn&#x27;t need a feature, it was out. This was a cold approach, and we believe the app is better for it. There were a number of things I set out at the start:

1. I check times pretty much every time I go to use a bus. This needs to be the primary focus of the app
2. I know where I am going - I don&#x27;t need maps
3. None of the bus stops I use regularly are termini, so the timetables are irrelevant guesswork
4. I rarely change the stops I use, but it may happen from time to time - obviously I need a way to edit them

The app that sprang to mind was the Weather App bundled with the iPhone. No need to tap anything - Tell it once what cities are of interest, and all I ever need to do is open it. There is no reason why checking my bus times should be different.

So, we came up with &quot;My Dublin Bus&quot;. When opened, it automatically grabs the real time information for your stops and displays it. No tapping, no finding of favourites - Just give me the information already.

Adding stops is a snap. Other apps ask you to search by stop number, route number, address and so forth. Why? Just find as you type with My Dublin Bus:

And, as we mentioned - The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we have had some feedback from people suggesting adding feature x or feature y. We consider every request; we really do. But if we feel that a feature may jeopardise the simplicity, we&#x27;ve elected to leave it out.

Sometimes, less is more.
