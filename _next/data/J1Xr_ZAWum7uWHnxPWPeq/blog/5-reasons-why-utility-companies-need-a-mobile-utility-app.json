Below are 5 reasons why utility companies should consider a mobile utility app for their business.\n\n#### Meeting the needs of customers\n\nOur fast-paced and digital lifestyles have led consumers to no longer want to deal with physical paper statements or engage in phone calls.\n\nMobile utility apps offer utility companies the perfect channel to meet the ever-evolving needs of their customers. Whether it’s a gas, electric or a water company, mobile utility apps offer a way of directly communicating and engaging with customers in a way that is convenient for the customer.\n\nA mobile utility app provides real-time access to up to date customer and utility service information that helps meet the demands of customers.\n\n#### Personalised User Experience\n\nThe user experience journey within apps is highly personalised. The entire journey can be tailored to users requirements. By gathering important insights from customer data utility companies can create a user experience that is designed to their specific needs and satisfaction.\n\nPersonalisation improves the customer experience by as much as 55%, and mobile apps are a perfect way to offer personalisation. Users have the option of receiving tailored information on their account, as well as receiving personalised push notifications. \n\nConsumers welcome this highly personalised user experience on apps that includes information on their billing and usage details, balances, and the ability to contact their service provider from within the app.\n\n#### Convenience\n\nMore than 60% of consumers prefer an automated self-service offering in a mobile app, and self-service offerings increase customer satisfaction by 11%. \n\nCustomers using their utility provider’s mobile utility app had a [15%](https://www.chartwellinc.com/engaging-utility-customers-in-the-digital-age/) increase in loyalty. Loyal customers are also likely to recommend their utility company, spend more, cost less to support and have a higher lifetime value.\n\nConvenience goes a long way in generating customer loyalty and adding to the bottom line.\n\n#### Speed and Access\n\nMobile apps are fast and reliable and are usually 1.5 times faster than mobile websites. They store data locally on the mobile device, which means they perform actions faster due to data retrieval happening instantly. \n\nUsers are also able to access basic information and functionality offline. This is a fundamental difference between a mobile app and website. Customers still need an internet connection to perform critical tasks such as a payment process.\n\n#### Revenue\n\nAn improved customer experience within a mobile app can increase revenue for utility companies by [5-10%](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/public%20and%20social%20sector/our%20insights/cx%20compendium%202017/customer-experience-compendium-july-2017.pdf) within two to three years.\n\n[86%](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2020/09/02/what-do-customers-want-from-their-electric-utility/) of utility customers are willing to spend more for a better customer experience and when customers are satisfied they are twice as likely to stay with their existing service provider. \n\nA [5%](https://www.bain.com) increase in customer retention produces more than a 25% increase in profit.\n\nTransaction completion rates are higher on mobile apps and having billing information registered means bills can be paid instantly. Mobile apps also allow for auto payments within the app. \n\nInvesting in the user experience of an app can really add to the bottom line for utility companies \n\nThe entire mobile app experience helps boost the customer experience and retention rates of customers.\n\n### Utility App Example - PrePay Power\n\n- ![](images/img-PREPAYPOWER-APP-698x1024.png)\n    \n- ![](images/prepaypower-spend-504x1024.png)\n    \n- ![](images/prepaypower-auto-topup-504x1024.png)\n    \n\n[PrePay Power Case Study](https://tapadoo.com/case-studies/prepay-power-app/)\n\nThe PrePay Power app is a pay as you go electricity utility app we developed for our client [PrePay Power](https://tapadoo.com/case-studies/prepay-power-app/). The app is native to iOS and Android and allows users to top up their electricity quickly and easily. \n\nBefore the app, users had to go to a local shop to buy a PrePay Power meter code and input that code into the meter in their home. Since the implementation of the app users no longer have to leave their home or go online to top up their electricity. Now all they have to do is log in to the app and input their top-up details and it happens instantly.\n\nPrepay Powers main objective with the utility app is convenience for the customer and to give customers full control over their electricity bills.\n\nThe company is going from strength to strength with a 29% increase in revenue in 2018 and the customer base expanding by 9% to 140,000.\n\nMaria Colgan\n\nDigital Marketing Manager\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
