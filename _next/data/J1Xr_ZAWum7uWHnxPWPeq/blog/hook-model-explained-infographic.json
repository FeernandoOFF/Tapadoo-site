Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, learning to use new features; these are the types of investments users make to improver their experience.\n\nIf the experience within your app takes users through this process repeatedly, it turns your app into a habit-forming product. In other words, an app that users keep coming back to.\n\nWe've written about it in more depth in another [post](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/habit-forming-app-development/) but for the purposes of this post we've summed everything up in the infographic below.\n\n![The Hook Model.
