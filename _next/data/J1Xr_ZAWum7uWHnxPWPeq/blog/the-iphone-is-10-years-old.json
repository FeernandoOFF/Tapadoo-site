{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"The iPhone is 10 Years Old","date":"2017-06-29","content":"\nSheesh. Where did the time fly. At the 7 year mark, I wrote an article for the Loop Insight Magazine.  Some people thought it was an \"iPhone Versus Android\" piece. It wasn't. It was about iconic brands, and desirable products.\n\nI predicted very early on in the iPhone's life that it would remain a leading iconic product for 20 years. That's a wild prediction.\n\nWe're 10 years in, and I stand by it.\n\nFor posterity, I published the [7 -year-mark article on Medium](https://medium.com/@dermdaly/but-its-not-an-actual-walkman-2fd98e201b0).  I hope you enjoy it.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
