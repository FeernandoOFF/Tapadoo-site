Disgruntled with the way the PageUp/PageDown/Home/End buttons only move the screen and not the cursor? Well, gruntle no more with this handy tip! _(Windows users can feel smug in the knowledge that their keyboards have always had this functionality\\*.)_\n\nIn ~/Library/, create a directory called KeyBindings. In this directory, create a file called DefaultKeyBinding.dict, and enter the following bit of crunchy magic goodness:\n\n{\n\"UF729\" = (\"moveToBeginningOfDocument:\",\"setMark:\"); \n\"UF72B\" = (\"moveToEndOfDocument:\",\"setMark:\");\n\"UF72C\" = (\"pageUp:\",\"setMark:\"); \n\"UF72D\" = (\"pageDown:\",\"setMark:\");\n}\n\nRestart any Cocoa application that that uses Cocoa Text System, and the new keybinding will take effect in that application, as if by magic!\n\n**CAVEAT:** XCode overrides the default text keyboard bindings, so you'll need to update the keyboard bindings manually.\n\nGoto Preferences / KeyBindings / Text Key Bindings, and update the following actions with the relevant keystrokes:\n\n> Mode to Beginning of Document: ↖  \n> Mode to End of Document: ↘  \n> Page Down: ↡  \n> Page Up: ↟\n\nNow, you have a wonderful keyboard with really actually usable and useful navigation keys!\n\n_\\* Shame about the rest of the Windows user experience, haha._\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
