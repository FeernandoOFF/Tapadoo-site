Jason Connery joins tapadoo where he's going to have a primary focus on Android App development.\n\nJason brings a wealth of server side API development experience to the company which will further strengthen our offerings; We all know that Apps are rarely standalone; A server side element is often required; Sometimes our clients have existing APIs, often we build them for them.\n\nWhen not writing code, Jason is a keen gamer, reader and movie watcher.
