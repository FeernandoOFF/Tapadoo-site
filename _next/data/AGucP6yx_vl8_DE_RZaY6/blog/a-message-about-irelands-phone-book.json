We regret to inform users that in light of a recent threat of legal challenge, we WILL NOT be providing a fix to the application in its current guise. We have also taken the decision to remove \"Ireland's Phone Book\" and \"Ireland's Phone Book Pro\" from the App store.\n\nWe are engaging with a number of potential partners with a view to a long term solution and hope to be able to announce something shortly.\n\nApologies for the inconvenience caused.\n","categories":["iephonebookcat","iphone","iphonedev","irishapps"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
