{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"E-Car dispatch 1","date":"2011-02-07","content":"\nBack in December, I blogged about tapadoo winning a competition with a prize of the use of an Electric Car for a month. Today, I picked up the Electric Car, so here's the initial thoughts. I plan on doing a few blog posts during the month long trial.\n\nThe day started with some promotional shots being taken, which ESB have kindly shared with me. Took about 20 minutes, and was a bit of fun. ![PS Ecar 8](images/PS-Ecar-8-681x1024.jpg \"PS Ecar 8\")\n\nAfter that it was back to ESB for a quick bit of explanation of the car, a scoot around the block, and some simple paperwork...And so I was on my way.\n\nSo, I've done two short journeys - One back to the office, and a second to a meeting across town.\n\nI gotta say, initially I'm impressed - The car is quite nippy, and amazingly quiet (some electric cars have sounds added externally for safety, but this one doesn't - It's a pre-production model, so may have this added in the future).\n\nDriving is like any small car (As far as I can remember - my last small car was around 1993)\n\nI'll post more thoughts as the trial continues.\n","categories":["ecar"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
