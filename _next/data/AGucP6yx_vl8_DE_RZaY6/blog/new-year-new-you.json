{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"New Year, New You","date":"2016-01-05","content":"\nDublin is awash with startups. It's a great vibe, and there's a real air of anticipation and positivity around Dublin right now.\n\nBut let's face it. Whilst there are many great teams, great ideas may be thinner on the ground. I've no doubt that right now, there's a talented team who are scratching their heads wondering if their idea was a good one in the first place. They've worked for months on it, and produced a pretty good MVP, but it just isn't getting traction, and the VCs aren't showing excitement either.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the idea that your startup will change the world. It's harder to look at it through the eyes of a person who hasn't put the months in and realise that it's not going to get off the ground.\n\nThose last few weeks are hard. They're the ones where you go from enthusiastic to unsure ... to ... \"what was I thinking?\" At some point, you have to face it and start looking for a new role.\n\nWhat if I told you we need all that great stuff you've learnt while working on your startup? What if you had all the freedom to build something, but from scratch, with no worries about if there's a salary next month?\n\nBecause that's what Tapadoo needs right now. We're looking to build our server side team, and we're starting by looking for a [Server Side Developer](https://tapadoo.workable.com/j/A42239E20E), and a [Front-end developer](https://tapadoo.workable.com/j/1F9A0BD996). Heck, if you come together, we'd want you more.\n\nWe've an immediate project, immediate need, and not a line of code written yet.\n\nIf any of this resonates, please get in touch. It might be just the role for you. Our current offerings are listed on [here](https://tapadoo.workable.com).\n","postImage":"https://cdn-bhcgp.nitrocdn.com/lQsUIlYWTGkhjqgYKmLJkHSBczAwGDPM/assets/static/optimized/rev-f8d7f54/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TeamTapadooBlog.jpg.webp","categories":["business"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
