They explained that they have drop-in facilities where people come to send packages worldwide.\n\nThe drop-in facilities rely heavily on paper forms, and with this, some transcribing problems. They knew there was a better way and asked if we could do and app for a kiosk.\n\n> gulp\n\nWell, we do apps. So we partnered with Shinnay, the good people who already refurbished our office to have a custom cabinet manufactured to our specifications.\n\nWe're delighted with the end result and DHL are too.
