{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"U2 were the absolute right band for Apple to give away an album","date":"2014-09-11","content":"\nAt the end of Apple's big announcement on Tuesday night (our time), Apple announced that U2's latest album was been given away to every iTunes customer for free. A whole album. For free. For everyone.\n\nThat's huge.\n\nAnd subsequently, Bono has written [a blog post about it](http://www.u2.com/news/title/remember-us), explaining how it was a gift from Apple. Essentially U2 were paid for every copy (at I'm sure, a discounted price, but a guaranteed one nonetheless).\n\nAnd of course out came the haters. The told us U2 are no longer cool, don't resonate with the audience, etc. etc. Heck Bono even had a jibe:\n\n> And for the people out there who have no interest in checking us out, look at it this wayâ€¦ the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys are in your junk mail.\n\n**The haters are wrong and here's why:**\n\n- No matter who you pick, you'll always have someone who doesn't like their music, and will be vocal about it\n- So it make sense to go with the most popular acts across your entire customer base; If you pick someone less popular, you have, by definition more people to disappoint\n- Apple have a stunning amount of data on music sales. So when someone in marketing says \"Who's the biggest band we could use to gift an album\", there's someone who can run a query and come back with a list of top-sellers\n- Taking a guess at who'd be in that list, I'm gonna say U2 were firmly in there. Like them or hate them, they're one of the biggest selling bands of all time\n- Unfortunately, many of the bigger sellers are no longer with us (Think Michael Jackson and Elvis)\n\nThe timing was great too: U2 were working on a new album, it seems like a great choice to me.\n\nThey could have given us a Justin Bieber album or A One Direction album. But would that lead to less uproar?\n\nPicture credit: [Matt McGee](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pleeker/76676872/in/photolist-7LZn3-76Tp2K-2aRaT-iLApt-kBX48K-6Ba1fG-a8DEK-a8DEM-5jn3MX-5USUVk-3WxAt-HXyL-7VPHzu-HXyQ-HXZj-HYjV-HXVf-gPScC-3WxDj-8ufnr-6MA8dL-9RJFxz-6Q7Axo-czEXu-Jhsu-6DYCN1-HXyK-HXyN-6Q7nt1-6Rwnry-HXyP-75FUZF-HXVa-bA8nCg-9eNS7T-HXZe-3494sG-bA8nCz-6RsiY2-jrnpV-7LZn1-6Rwnzo-344tYn-c1XG5m-6RwnCU-HXZf-HXyM-aTg6j-HYHj-i3FCL)\n","postImage":"https://2upm2b1wdft320vzjj34rpga-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76676872_8312c76522_o.jpg.webp"}},"__N_SSG":true}
