Everyone sat around eating cake, and I asked\n\n> so who's up next?\n\nAnd it snowballed from there. So each week, someone gets a turn. They make a cake and on Tuesday or Wednesday morning we take 20 minutes. To eat cake. And to talk about how the cake was made.\n\nIt's just a little break from developing apps.

We should all do that from time to time.\n\n[![Cake-12](images/Cake-12.png)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cake-12.png)\n\n[![Cake-11](images/Cake-11.png)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cake-11.png)\n\n[![Cake-20](images/Cake-20.png)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cake-20.png)\n","postImage":"https://2upm2b1wdft320vzjj34rpga-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cake-5.png.webp","categories":["life-at-tapadoo"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
