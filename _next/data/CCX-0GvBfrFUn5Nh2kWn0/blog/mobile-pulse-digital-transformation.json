Mobile minutes are becoming an integral part of a consumers day. From checking the weather, emails and SMS to organising travel and everything in between.\n\nMobile usage has skyrocketed over the last number of years. And will continue to do so given the sophistication and development of the smartphone.\n\n### **The rise of the mobile app**\n\nWith our most trusted device at our fingertips, it makes sense for businesses to consider how to innovate and communicate with their customers.\n\nAn app is one such way.\n\nThe rise of the mobile app has enabled consumers to do numerous tasks on their smartphone. And for many, mobile apps have replaced their watch, alarm clock, GPS, calendar, camera, maps and more.\n\nGoogle is the powerhouse driving digital transformation through their convenient mobile apps. From Google Maps, Drive, Calendar and Photos, to Docs, Sheets and of course the well known Google Chrome.\n\n### **How mobile app usage is affecting industry**\n\nFlurry tracks more than one million applications, across 2.6 billion devices globally. Their 2017 [report](http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/169545749110/state-of-mobile-2017-mobile-stagnates) shows that users spend more than five hours a day on their smartphones, and shift their time between new and old app experiences. \n\nTheir 2018 mobile app usage [report](http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/169545749110/state-of-mobile-2017-mobile-stagnates) shows that mobile app usage is growing 6% year on year.\n\n#### eCommerce\n\nLeading the charge is eCommerce. The shopping category increased by 54% with consumers spending through a mobile app. Retailers can utilise the power of digital transformation with a move from a web browsing based experience to a mobile app.\n\n#### Music, Media and Entertainment\n\nMusic, Media and Entertainment had a 43% year on year growth. No surprises here considering how easy the likes of iTunes, Spotify and Netflix make it for customers to pay and consume information.\n\n#### Lifestyle\n\nLifestyle had a deep incline of -40%. This highlights that businesses need to build in daily usage habits for their consumers to increase usage. We can’t just rely on digital transformation by adopting a new technology. We need to make this technology work for us. That’s the real success of digital transformation.\n\n**[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile.

It has been the top contender for mobile phone usage minutes per consumer. There was a slight decline for 2018 but nothing to be too concerned about.\n\nThe table below shows the top five countries that are driving 50% of gaming usage. According to [Electronic Entertainment Design and Research](https://www.eedar.com), users are spending more than 50% a week on mobile games in North America. And they use a smartphone and a tablet in 60% of all cases. But apparently the real gaming enthusiasts are in Europe, with the Netherlands and Sweden spending 31% of all their app sessions on games.\n\n[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile.

Their graph below illustrates the online searches initiated on a mobile device by industry. Food and beverage topped the chart along with health. Great opportunities for these brands to engage with their target audience on their mobile device.\n\n \n\n**[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile.

This chart indicates the need for a multichannel marketing approach.\n\n[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile.

[eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/B2B-Content-Marketers-Miss-Mobile-Mark/1012093) 2015\n\n[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile. Graphic of importance of mobile apps for B2B content from eMarketer 2015.](images/185275-300x230.png)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/185275.png)\n\n[Source](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/B2B-Content-Marketers-Miss-Mobile-Mark/1012093)\n\nMarketers may believe mobile apps are a vital part of their marketing efforts but a 2015 report by [Regalix,](https://www.regalix.com) showed that only 33% of respondents used mobile to distribute content. A big contrast compared to website at 95% and what many consider to be intrusive; email at 90%. \n\n![](images/pastedGraphic_1.png)\n\n[Source](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/B2B-Content-Marketers-Miss-Mobile-Mark/1012093)\n\n### **Multichannel Marketing Approach**\n\nTo maximise the marketing efforts of any business, we need to consider a multichannel marketing approach. This approach sees a marketer apply a single strategy across multiple channels or platforms. Therefore, giving your business the opportunity to engage potential customers in a way that is convenient for them.\n\nA multichannel approach means applying your efforts to all channels and measuring the results to see which are most effective. Mobile is one such channel and as the stats above show, if a business doesn’t have mobile as part of their strategy, they are missing out on this growing opportunity. \n\nOf course the more traditional routes or channels apply such as website, email, print, media, physical location and promotional events. But any marketer worth their weight will do their research, apply it to their business and make the most of the channels that reach their consumers in a targeted and sustainable way.\n\n### **Driving your consumers through the funnel**\n\nThe more visible your brand, the more opportunities to direct your consumers down the funnel. Marketers know the importance of the funnel, from generating awareness to creating your brand advocates. It all starts with your multichannel marketing approach.\n\nAccording to [SailThru](https://www.sailthru.com/marketing-blog/written-multi-channel-b2c-campaigns-realize-a-24-greater-return-on-investment-2/) 2015, multichannel B2C marketing campaigns realise a 24% greater return on investment using a multichannel marketing approach.\n\nAnd the image below from SnapApp 2018 proves this point by showing how consumers take a multichannel approach to purchasing. If this is the route that consumers are taking, then it makes sense that businesses adopt this as a strategy.\n\n **[![Digital transformation and consumer engagement through mobile. Graphic of how consumers take a multi-device path to purchase SnapApp 2018](images/Multi-channel-breakdown-300x179.png)](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Multi-channel-breakdown.png)**\n\n[Source](https://www.snapapp.com/blog/multichannel-marketing/)\n\nCJD Digital Marketing provide a very useful [infographic](http://cjgdigitalmarketing.com/the-power-of-multi-channel-digital-marketing-campaign-infographic/) on their website, which shows the power of a multichannel digital marketing campaign. Some key takeaways are:\n\n- Brands moving into a multi-channel digital marketing strategy are achieving up to 300% improvement on ROI from their advertising efforts.\n- This resulted from a 24% increase in conversion rates, as more targeted customers see a campaign’s ads from multiple channels.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nMobile is the pulse of digital transformation. But not in isolation. The key to success is a multichannel marketing approach, where a marketer picks the right channels to maximise the potential to market their brand.\n\nHow do we do this?\n\nResearch. \n\nKnow where our consumers are hanging out and make the most of the latest technologies. Give consideration to the technologies that can lend to our digital transformation.\n\nAs marketers, we can sometimes get stuck in how we do things. This stagnant approach can limit our reach. But if innovation is the name of the game and if mobile is leading this, then we need to give it the attention it deserves. \n\nThe figures speak for themselves.\n\nThe strategy specific for your business, be it an app or a mobile-first web approach, is based on your consumer behaviour and usability.\n\nBut know this; more and more consumers are trusting their mobile devices to make purchases than ever before. If you are in the business of eCommerce and haven’t considered mobile as part of your strategy, then maybe now is the time.\n\nAnd for businesses with an existing mobile app, the data from this can help execute an effective multichannel marketing campaign. Using the data from your brand's mobile app can provide insights into customers behaviours on their mobile devices. \n\nData such as when and where they launch the app can be used to create personalised offers. Other key transactions such as installs and interactions, can provide the foundation for a targeted marketing campaign across all digital platforms.\n\nMobile can play an important role in your multichannel marketing effort and put your business ahead of the game in this time of digital transformation.\n\nMaria Colgan\n\nDigital Marketing Manager\n\n##### If you have an app idea that you would like to discuss [get in touch](https://tapadoo.wpengine.com/contact/)\n","postImage":"https://cdn-bhcgp.nitrocdn.com/lQsUIlYWTGkhjqgYKmLJkHSBczAwGDPM/assets/static/optimized/rev-f8d7f54/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rodion-kutsaev-184298-unsplash.jpg.webp","categories":["marketing"],"tags":["digital-transformation","ecommerce","mobile","mobile-apps","multichannel-marketing"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
