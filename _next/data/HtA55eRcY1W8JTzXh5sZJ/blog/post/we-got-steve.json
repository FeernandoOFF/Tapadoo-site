We put out a tweet looking for an intern, and were delighted that Steven Troughton-Smith expressed an interest.\n\nFor those of you who within the iPhone development community, Steven needs no introduction. For the rest of you, let me explain.\n\n![Steven Troughton-Smith](images/sts-300x274.png \"Steven Troughton-Smith\") Steven has garnered plenty of attention for his accomplishments as an iPhone developer. He's been featured on [RTE News](http://vimeo.com/3289258) during the iPhone Gold Rush of '08, and [more recently for his app \"Grace\"](http://vimeo.com/8124035), an iPhone app which helps Autistic children communicate.\n\nEngadget have also been [interested in his work on jailbroken devices](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/15/jailbroken-iphone-gets-expose-like-view-you-retail-users-just-k/), while Gizmodo also broke the story of [how Steve hacked the palm pre](http://gizmodo.com/5288989/running-custom-firmware-on-the-palm-pre-is-rather-easy).\n\nPhew! Hopefully, we'll be able to channel all this enthusiasm!\n\nI'm sure you'll join me in welcoming Steven to the team at Tapadoo\n","categories":["business"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
